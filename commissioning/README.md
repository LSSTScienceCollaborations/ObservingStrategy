# Suggestions for Commissioning Observations

While we write down our science cases and code up their metrics and
Figures of Merit, we can also think about which kinds of observations or experiments 
we might want to do during commissioning to prepare for doing science when the full survey
starts.

## Guidelines

The [LSST Observing Strategy White Paper](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/raw/master/whitepaper/LSST_Observing_Strategy_White_Paper.pdf) contains an overview of LSST science programs that depend on the details of LSST's observing strategy.   This white paper presents a set of MAF based metrics for a variety of science programs.  Some of the science cases presented would benefit from early data during commissioning either to validate and refine algorithms, bootstrap algorithms to be used in the full survey or provide value added in the science of the full survey (e.g. filling in time sampling that the main survey won't do).

When considering a proposed observing run that would be done in commissioning, consider what could be done with the commissioning camera (ComCam - 3x3 4k x 4k CCDs in a single raft with 45 arcmin FOV) and what would need the full camera.  Think also about data that can be obtained in an hour, a night and/or a week or so. 

To suggest a new `Commissioning Observation or Experiment`, you will need to write a very short *proposal*. You can do this in a markdown file following [this template](https://github.com/cclaver/ObservingStrategy/blob/master/commissioning/commProp_Template.md) and check it into the `commissioning` folder of this repository. Then, add it to the Table below, so everyone can see what you are suggesting and follow the link to your proposal.
