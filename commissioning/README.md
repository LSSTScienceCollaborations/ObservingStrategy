# Suggestions for Commissioning Observations

While we write down our science cases and code up their metrics and
Figures of Merit, we can also think about which kind of observations we
want during commissioning to prepare for doing science when the full
starts.

## Guidelines

The [LSST Observing Strategy White Paper](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/raw/master/whitepaper/LSST_Observing_Strategy_White_Paper.pdf) contains a chapters listing the MAF based metrics for a variety of science programs.  Some of the science case presented would benefit from earaly data during commissioning either to validate and refine algorithms, bootstrap algorithms used in the full survey or provide value added in the science of the full survey (e.g. filling in time sampling the main survey won't do).

When considering a proposed obsering run that would be done in commissioning consider what you might want from the commissioning camera (ComCam - 3x3 4k x 4k CCDs in a single raft with 45 arcmin FOV) and what you might want from the full camera.  Think also about data that can be obtained in an hour, a night and/or a week or so. 

To suggest a new `Commissioning Run` run, you will (of course) need to write a very short *proposal*. You can do this in a markdown file following [this template](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/blob/issue64/opsim/Proposal_Template.md) and check it into the `opsim` folder of this repository. Then, add it to the Table below, so everyone can see what you are suggesting and follow the link to your proposal.
