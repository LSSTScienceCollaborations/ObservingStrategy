# "1-Hour r-band Time Series"

A Proposed OpSim Experiment.

*Proposer(s): Chuck Claver*

*Issue thread: [#69](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/69)*

## Proposed Commissioning Observation/Experiment

In a specified sky area, with good seeing (<0.8 arcsec) obtain a 1 hour long 
continuous sequence of 15-sec exposures in the r-band.

## Technical and/or Science Motivation

Testing image differencing and alert production; PSF characterization and photometric repeatability.
