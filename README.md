# Science-Driven Optimization of the LSST Observing Strategy

Welcome to the online community thinking about LSST survey strategy ("cadence"), with quantifications via the Metric Analysis Framework.

Together, we are developing the LSST Community Observing Strategy Evaluation Paper (COSEP), a living document that explores the effects that changes to the LSST survey strategy would have on the detailed performance of the anticipated science investigations.

You may have heard of the coming  "Cadence Wars" - the COSEP represents the "Cadence Diplomacy" that will allow us, as a community, to avoid, or at least manage, that conflict.
As it explains in its introduction, the COSEP is "_the_ vehicle for the community to communicate to the LSST Project regarding the Wide-Fast-Deep and special survey observing strategies."
We welcome contributions from all around the LSST Science community.

The first version of the COSEP was posted to the arxiv in Summer 2017, and can be downloaded [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04058v1).
It was structured as a set of individual science cases that are each very important, and/or somehow stress the observing strategy; each of these sections described how we expect them to be sensitive to LSST observing strategy, and many included a MAF metric analysis (or the design of one). These science sections formed the quantitative backbone of the document, and followed an introductory chapter that laid out the suite of LSST Project-simulated cadences that existed at the time. The v1 COSEP's primary conclusions were:

1. The LSST Project should simulate, analyze and optimize the rolling cadence idea;
2. The LSST Project should execute a systematic effort to further improve the ultimate LSST survey strategy.

These conclusions informed the 2018 [Call for White Papers on LSST Cadence Optimization](https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-28382), which anticipates that the performance evaluation components of the white papers solicited will also be added to the COSEP, to provide a comprehensive reference point for survey strategy evaluation. We are currently setting up the COSEP to accept the 2018 white papers, on the way to producing version 2 in April 2019.

This effort is being coordinated by [Phil Marshall](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/new?body=@drphilmarshall) (the v1 COSEP's editor-in-chief), with guidance from [Zeljko Ivezic](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/new?body=@ivezic) and [Lynne Jones](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/new?body=@rhiannonlynne). Any of them can propagate your privately-communicated concerns into a redacted issue on this repository. Contributions are very welcome from all round the LSST science collaborations, and beyond. Perhaps we are missing a science case? Or an idea for how to perturb the observing strategy? We'd like to hear from you! Please send all your feedback to [this repo's issues](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues).
