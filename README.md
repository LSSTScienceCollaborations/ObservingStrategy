# Observing Strategy

A community white paper about LSST observing strategy, with quantifications via the the Metric Analysis Framework. We will draft the individual science cases, and how we expect them to be sensitive to LSST observing strategy, during the first half of 2015. Then, MAF metric calculations designed and executed during the 2015 MAF Workshop (to be held in Seattle, WA, August 17-21) and afterwards will form the quantitative backbone of the document. You may have heard of the coming  "Cadence Wars" - this document represents the scientific diplomacy that will allow us, as a community, to avoid, or at least manage, that conflict.

This effort is being coordinated by Zeljko Ivezic.Perhaps we are missing a science area? Or an idea for how to perturb the observing strategy? We'd like to hear form you. Please send all feedback via [this repo's issues.](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues).
