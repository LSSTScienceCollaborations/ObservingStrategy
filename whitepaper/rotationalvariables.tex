\section{Age-Mapping the Galaxy Using Gyrochronology}
\def\secname{rotatationalvariables}\label{sec:\secname}

\noindent{\it Author Name(s)} % (Writing team)

% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

This section describes recovering stellar rotation periods as a means to mapping ages of stellar populations in the Galaxy.
