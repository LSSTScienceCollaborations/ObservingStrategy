\section{Cosmological Weak Lensing with WFIRST and LSST}
\def\secname{\chpname:weaklensing}\label{sec:\secname}

%note to Phil-  I am not sure if there will be another section that serves as an intro to WFIRST, but I am doing that here
%also, I think we should make this about more than just WL.  Can we change the name and focus of the section to the High Latitude Survey.  The driver %is still probably weak lensing!

\textbf{Intro to WFIRST} 
The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a NASA mission that entered Phase A in February 2016.  WFIRST was the highest recommendation for large space missions in the 2010 New Worlds New Horizons Decadal Survey.  That recommendation envisioned a wide-field observatory with near infrared (NIR) capabilities to complement LSST's optical capabilities; the Decadal Survey recognized the obvious synergy between WFIRST and LSST.  WFIRST's design has evolved since 2010 and the design being pursued for a mid-2020s launch uses an existing $2.4$m telescope donated to NASA, giving WFIRST capabilities not envisioned by the Decadal Survey.  WFIRST has 3 primary science objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the nature of the dark energy that is driving the current accelerating expansion of the universe using a combination of weak lensing, galaxy clustering (including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift Space Distortions), and supernovae type Ia (SN).
\item Study exoplanets through a statistical microlensing survey and via direct imaging and spectroscopy with a coronagraph. 
\item Perform NIR surveys of the galactic and extragalactic sky via a Guest Observer program. 
\end{itemize}
WFIRST will be at L2 to enable the thermal stability required for the precise astrometric, photometric, and morphological measurements required for these science goals. The baseline WFIRST mission architecture is described in detail in the final report of the WFIRST Science Definition Team (arxiv/1503.03757). The Wide Field Instrument(WFI) has a NIR focal plane with a $\sim0.28$ square degree field of view made up 18 4k$\times$4k Teledyne H4RG NIR detectors will have imaging capabilities from $0.7-2$ microns and grism spectroscopy capabilities from $1.35-1.89$ microns with $R\sim461\lambda$.  The WFI also contains an Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrometer with $R\sim100$ resoluton over the range $0.6-2$ microns for SN follow up. The exoplanet coronagraph will have imaging ($0.43-0.97$ microns) and spectroscopic ($0.6-0.97 $ microns) capabilities with a contrast ratio of 1 part in a billion.

WFIRST's  6 year primary mission will have 2 years dedicated to a $\sim2200$ square degree High Latitude Survey (HLS) for weak lensing and galaxy clustering,  1 year of microlensing observations divided into 6 seasons, $0.6$ years of SN search and follow-up, one year dedicated to the coronagraph and 1.4 years dedicated to competitively selected Guest Observer observations. WFIRST has no expendables that would prevent an extended mission of 10 years or longer, and an extended mission would be given over entirely to Guest Observer observations. 

 \textbf{WFIRST's High Latitude Survey (HLS)}
 WFIRST's HLS will cover 2200 square degrees in 4 NIR photometric filters (3 of which will be sufficiently sampled for weak lensing shape measurements) and NIR grism spectroscopy.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

Describe the discoveries and measurements you want to make.

Now, describe their response to the observing strategy. Qualitatively,
how will the science project be affected by the observing schedule and
conditions? In broad terms, how would we expect the observing strategy
to be optimized for this science?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

Quantifying the response via MAF metrics: definition of the metrics,
and any derived overall figure of merit.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
the time of writing for this science project?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
the identified risks?
