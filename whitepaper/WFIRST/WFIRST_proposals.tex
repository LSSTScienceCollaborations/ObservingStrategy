%    Maximizing the overlap between LSST and WFIRST is likely to be a fruitful
%    approach to modifying the LSST observing strategy. Let's pull together the
%    findings from the three WFIRST science cases and propose some OpSim
%    experiments.

In the previous sections, we introduced figures of merit for each WFIRST
science project, and tested the existing LSST observing strategies for
their performance. In the process we learned some of the shortcomings of the
baseline LSST strategy, and suggested some alternative cadence
options. In this section, we pull those suggestions together to propose a
suite of new OpSim experiments.
