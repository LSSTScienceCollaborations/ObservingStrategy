%    Maximizing the overlap between LSST and WFIRST is likely to be a fruitful
%    approach to modifying the LSST observing strategy. Let's pull together the
%    findings from the three WFIRST science cases and propose some OpSim
%    experiments.

%
% In the previous sections, we introduced figures of merit for each WFIRST
% science project, and tested the existing LSST observing strategies for
% their performance. In the process we learned some of the shortcomings of the
% baseline LSST strategy, and suggested some alternative cadence
% options. In this section, we will pull those suggestions together to propose a
% suite of new \OpSim experiments.
