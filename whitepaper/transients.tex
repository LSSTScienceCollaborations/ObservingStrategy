\section{Introduction}


Explosive and eruptive transients are physically and
phenomenologically diverse.   What these events share
are rare, large-amplitude deviations from a quiescent state.  These
outbursts are typically unpredictable and of limited duration, and so their
discovery and characterization are sensitive to the detailed observing
strategy.  Often, followup observations with other facilities can provide
significant additional scientific value, but this creates a challenge to
identify candidate events while they are still visible.

Transients such as novae, supernovae (SNe), and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
probe the final stages of stellar evolution. Tidal Disruption Events
(TDEs), short GRBs, and
Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) give us the opportunity to study
compact and binary objects. Massive star eruptions allow us to understand
mass loss mechanisms and chemical enrichment.
The brightest transients (GRBs, TDEs,
SNe) are light beams that can be seen over cosmic distances, and some
transients---most notably Type Ia SNe---are cosmological tracers.
In this chapter we focus on LSST's potential to advance the astrophysics of
eruptive and explosive transients; the use of SNe for cosmology is
discussed in \autoref{chp:cosmo}. Transients in the Milky Way Disk are
discussed in more detail in \autoref{chp:galaxy}.

Cadence choices will determine LSST's ability to discover, classify, and
characterize these events. However, due to their different time scales,
different phenomena will benefit from different sampling
strategies---sometimes
significantly different, and at times orthogonal.  Competing objectives
described in this chapter are at the heart of LSST's observing strategy and
cadence design.

When evaluating a particular observation or series of observations in
light of how they perform for a specific science case, it may be
helpful to think of metrics as lying along a continuum between
discovery and characterization. Discovery requires a minimum amount of
information to recognize an event or object as a candidate of
interest.  It is particulary relevant for science cases that require
triggering followup resources in real time from the live event stream.

Characterization, on the other hand, implies
that basic properties of the event may be determined from the
LSST observations, including but not limited to the classification of
the event.
It is particular relevant for science cases requiring analysis of large
samples of completed lightcurves.

Characterization and classification of transient events
benefits from substantial temporal sampling over the finite duration of the
event along with color information (perhaps contemporaneous).
Transient events slower than $\sim$ weeks may be adequately sampled by
a uniform LSST cadence.  Obtaining adequate sampling for faster-evolving
events may require special scheduling
strategies.  For some event types, LSST can only be expected to
provide a discovery service, and followup will necessarily be
performed elsewhere---so long as the cadence is sufficient to identify the
event type.
For some events, such as detecting electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave events (GWs),
serendipitous discoveries are unlikely, but
enabling a ToO program would provide the opportunity for LSST to
contribute significantly to this science.

%The interpretation of a given metric along this continuum has
%implications for the subsequent action and analysis required,
%particularly as regards possible follow-up observations with other
%facilities.

We consider a non-exhaustive set of ``astronomical transients'' in the
paragraphs that follow. For a few of these transients, we quantify the
ability of LSST cadences to produce data useful for various science
goals. These case studies include SNe, GRBs, and GWs. For other
transient families (Novae, LBVs, TDEs) we provide more general
information in \autoref{sec:\chpname:future}, and we invite the
community to further develop the ideas proposed here, as well as
further other related goals, into quantified science cases.

\subsection{Transient time scales}

Optical transients display a wide range of intrinsic timescales
(\autoref{fig:transient_phase_space}), and even some long-lived events
have short-duration features of interest.

For very short-lived phenomena (stellar flares, GRBs),
the main function of LSST will be to provide discoveries and/or simple
characterization.  Followup to discovery/identification, if required,
must take place elsewhere. This implies that the LSST observations
must be sufficient to recognize in real time that an event is fast-evolving
in order to to trigger followup. However, assessing the rise
slope is best done with a single filter,
because when observing with different
filters it is very difficult to separate lightcurve evolution from
color variations. Colors are informative when considering statistical
samples (\autoref{sec:\chpname:SNtransients}) as long as the epoch of peak
can be reliably determined.

SNe fall in an intermediate time range.  LSST will provide
multiple visits in multiple filters during the typical SN duration
(months).  This sampling may still be insufficient for many science
objectives, such as photometric classification of SN subtypes.
However, moderate changes to LSST
observing strategy may enhance the sampling for part of the sky part
of the time, greatly improving the usefulness of SN observations.
Metrics that assess the discovery rate of SN are included in
\autoref{chp:cosmo}.
Here we are interested in assessing the ability of
LSST to discriminate SN from other transients, SN subtypes from one
another, and to identify particularly interesting SNe: for example
those that show signature of shock break-out, companion interaction
in the early light curve, or would be candidates for \emph{flash
spectroscopy} follow-up \citep[e.g.,][]{2014Natur.509..471G}.
In addition, metrics that
quantify LSST's ability to constrain SN physics in a statistically
large sample of SN are needed.

TDEs have only recently started to be characterized in the optical
bands. The current sample of events show relatively long
time-scales (rise and decline of the light curve is over months). We
would like to assess through metrics how well TDEs can be
distinguished from supernovae based on their light curve shape and
color (in real-time so that followup observations can be triggered)
and how well the LSST light curves themselves can be used to model the
TDE emission and deduce the black hole properties.
%Ref. Science Book:
%10.6.1, \citet{Gezari2012, Chornock2014, Arcavi2014, Holoien2014,
%Holoien2015, Holoien2016}.

Large amplitude flares from AGN may mimic
explosive transients; they are discussed in \autoref{chp:agn}.

In addition we hope that LSST will provide a wealth of serendipitous
discoveries of yet-to-be-observed transients.  An ideal transient
discovery survey would include balanced coverage of all time scales. LSST
will cover longer time periods well, but will have to make some
choices of emphasis in coverage of shorter time-scales.

In the sections that follow we will use several case studies to assess
LSST's performance for a range of time-domain science:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The ability of a given LSST cadence to discriminate truly young
  transients from those only first detected well after their explosion date (\autoref{sec:\chpname:transientsAge}).
  This ability is a crucial input to follow-up strategy design.
  We identify a region of lightcurve slope
  % the phase-space of rising speed and color
  that is characteristic of a
  variety of transients in their early phases and assess the ability of LSST's
  cadences to place transients within this phase-space.
  More sophisticated classification algorithms will likely be necessary, but
  are beyond the scope of this whitepaper.
\item
  The statistical constraints to a transient class that can be obtained
  over the course of the LSST survey, from the LSST survey data alone
  (assuming a successful classification). We discuss SN Ia early interaction
  signatures and IIb shock break-out (\autoref{sec:\chpname:SNtransients}).
\item
  The ability to identify in real-time a rapidly-evolving
  object of interest and
  trigger prompt follow-up observations. For this topic GRBs are used as
  a case study (\autoref{sec:\chpname:grbs}).
\item
  The value of triggered Target-of-Opportunity observations for
  following up very rare, fast-evolving events.   Here the kilonova
  counterparts expected from Advanced LIGO triggers are used as a
  case study (\autoref{sec:\chpname:gw}).
\item
  The insight that a cadence gives into single transient classes. We
  discuss CVs, massive star eruptions, and TDEs (\autoref{sec:\chpname:future}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\chpname:metrics}

Two metrics were developed and are used in this chapter specifically for transient phenomena:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\metric{transientAsciiMetric}: accepts an ASCII file in input, so that realistic transient shapes can be used, with different shapes for different filters. The output can be the series of LSST observations (magnitude and error), or the fraction of transients detected (with user-specified constraints). This metric is used in \autoref{sec:\chpname:SNtransients}.}
  \item{\metric{GRBTransientMetric}: calculates the fraction of GRB-like transients detected (with user-specified constraints) using an $F(t) \propto t^{-\alpha}$
    lightcurve. This metric is used in \autoref{sec:\chpname:grbs}}.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the standard MAF metrics
that quantify the gaps between consecutive visits to
a field within a night and over multiple nights
(\MAFmetric{IntraNightGapsMetric} and \MAFmetric{InterNightGapsMetric})
are of great value and are
heavily used throughout this chapter, in \autoref{sec:\chpname:transientsAge},
~\autoref{sec:\chpname:SNtransients}, and~\autoref{sec:\chpname:gw} for example.
These quantify the median times between consecutive visits to a field
within one night and over multiple nights, respectively.

Further metrics relevant to transient science are discused in \autoref{chp:galaxy},~\autoref{chp:cosmo}, and ~\autoref{chp:variables}.

Many science cases can be developed and tested with these metrics, and we
encourage users to do so. In addition, we are collecting a library of representative transient lightcurves in a separate GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/LSSTTVS/LSST_TVS_RoadMap}} and we encourage readers to contribute their transient models or observations.

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\chpname:analysis}

The current set of simulated cadences
provide poor coverage in any one
filter for transient events longer than a visit pair ($\sim$30
minutes) and shorter than $\sim$ weeks (\autoref{fig:tgaps} and
\autoref{fig:tgaps_r}; \autoref{tab:visitgaps}).

As discussed in the subsequent sections, this
gap in the sampling hinders characterization of fast-evolving
transients.  A cadence with two visits separated by an hour or two rather
than 20 minutes would provide better discrimination.  A third visit in the
same night in a different filter would provide
color information valuable for realtime classification.
If a subset of those third
visits were in the same filter as the first two, it would improve the shape
characterization of the fastest-evolving transients.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\chpname:discussion}

LSST's currently simulated cadences have significant cadence gaps for
timescales between nightly visit pairs and intra-night revisits.  For
many transient science cases, rolling-type cadences that improve the
sampling of a subset of events may be helpful in maximizing the
transient science that can be done with LSST: the minimum lightcurve
sampling required to adequately discover or characterize them may
still be larger than that provided by baseline cadences.  However,
even moderate adjustments (e.g., lengthening the visit pair spacing,
or optimizing the deep drilling filter strategy) may yield
improvements.


The metrics presented in these sections are initial efforts towards
quantifying these goals, and they suggest specific directions for new
OpSIM experiments.  More detailed efforts to understand and model the
challenging problem of transient classification with sparse
lightcurves will be needed in order to best guide LSST's time-domain
observing strategy.
