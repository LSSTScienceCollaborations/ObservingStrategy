\section{Age-Mapping the Galaxy Using Gyrochronology}

mapping ages of stellar populations in the Galaxy.

% \subsection{Conclusions}
%
% Here we answer the ten questions posed in
% \autoref{sec:intro:evaluation:caseConclusions}:
%
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[Q1:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between the sky coverage and coadded depth? For example, should
% the sky coverage be maximized (to $\sim$30,000 deg$^2$, as e.g., in
% Pan-STARRS) or the number of detected galaxies (the current baseline 
% of 18,000 deg$^2$)?}
%
% \item[A1:] ...
%
% \item[Q2:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between uniformity of sampling and frequency of  sampling? For
% example, a rolling cadence can provide enhanced sample rates over a part
% of the survey or the entire survey for a designated time at the cost of
% reduced sample rate the rest of the time (while maintaining the nominal
% total visit counts).}
%
% \item[A2:] Stellar rotation periods are deduced from photometric changes due to surface patterns. Therefore
%a sufficiently dense sampling is required before the surface pattern (e.g. spots) changes significantly. This
% will be best satisfied with cadences optimized for quasi-periodic fluctuations with time scales of 1-10 days.
%
% \item[Q3:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between the single-visit depth and the number of visits
% (especially in the $u$-band where longer exposures would minimize the
% impact of the readout noise)?}
%
% \item[A3:] ...
%
% \item[Q4:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% Galactic plane coverage (spatial coverage, temporal sampling, visits per
% band)?}
%
% \item[A4:] Gyrochronology is primarily of interest for galactic science, and needs better temporal sampling
%than expected from a uniform survey,
%
% \item[Q5:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% fraction of observing time allocated to each band?}
%
% \item[A5:] ...
%
% \item[Q6:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% cadence for deep drilling fields?}
%
% \item[A6:] ...
%
% \item[Q7:] {\it Assuming two visits per night, would the science case
% benefit if they are obtained in the same band or not?}
%
% \item[A7:] ...
%
% \item[Q8:] {\it Will the case science benefit from a special cadence
% prescription during commissioning or early in the survey, such as:
% acquiring a full 10-year count of visits for a small area (either in all
% the bands or in a  selected set); a greatly enhanced cadence for a small
% area?}
%
% \item[A8:] ...
%
% \item[Q9:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% sampling of observing conditions (e.g., seeing, dark sky, airmass),
% possibly as a function of band, etc.?}
%
% \item[A9:] ...
%
% \item[Q10:] {\it Does the case have science drivers that would require
% real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant
% single-visit limiting depth?}
%
% \item[A10:] ...
%
