\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:wfirst:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

WFIRST-AFTA is a wide field infra-red survey telescope being designed for
survey operations in the mid 2020's. It will carry out a large area survey,
likely covering around X000 square degrees, for weak lensing and large scale
structure cosmology, and also smaller targeted surveys to enable supernova
cosmology and exoplanetary microlensing searches.

The synergy with LSST is very promising indeed. In this chapter we lay out
three specific projects in the three main WFIRST science areas, and test the
simulated LSST Observing Strategies for their performance in each case. Then,
we use these results to design a suite of modified LSST Observing Strategies,
which we propose as new OpSim simulation runs.
