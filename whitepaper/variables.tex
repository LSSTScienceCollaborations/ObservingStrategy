\section{Introduction}

Variable objects are defined as those that exhibit brightness changes,
either periodic or non-periodic, which are detected in quiescence and
non-destructive to the object itself. Variable objects span a wide range
in timescale-of-interest (sometimes even within a single class of
objects), and so different science cases benefit from different sampling
strategies. These strategies may be significantly disparate from one
another, sometimes even mutually exclusive; competing objectives
described in this chapter and the next are therefore at the heart of
LSST observing strategy and cadence design.

Below we develop a number of key science cases for LSST studies of
variable objects, associating them with related metrics that can be used
within the Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF) to understand the impact of
a given survey strategy realization on the scientific results for that
case. The science cases outlined are by no means exhaustive, but rather
are motivated by providing key quantitative examples of LSST's
performance given any particular deployment of survey strategy. The
authors encourage community contribution of similar cases, where the
scientific outcome can be quantified using specific metrics.



%When evaluating a particular observation or series of observations in
%light of how they perform for a specific science case, it may be
%helpful to think of metrics as lying along a continuum between
%discovery and characterization. Discovery requires a minimum amount of
%information to recognize an event or object as a candidate of
%interest, which necessarily involves some level of bare-bones
%characterization (upon which said recognition is based); rich
%characterization, on the other hand, implies that an event may not
%only be recognized as a candidate of interest, but basic properties of
%the event or object may be determined from the observation (e.g.
%including but not limited to classification of the event). The
%interpretation of a given metric along this continuum has implications
%for the subsequent action and analysis required, particularly as
%regards possible follow-up observations with other facilities.

%Target types are here grouped in subsections by variability
%characteristics, but as will be seen, this does not mean that all
%targets in a group require a common cadence, since the times scales
%may vary dramatically.  Acquiring suitable data for a wide range of
%time scales presents a fundamental problem for LSST, since the
%available $~$800 visits to a field over the survey cannot be deployed
%so as to usefully sample all time scales at all times.  This fact
%leads to the concept of a non-uniform survey, in which parts of the
%sky are visited more frequently part of the time.  The merits of such
%options must be traded against the benefits of a more uniform survey
%strategy.
