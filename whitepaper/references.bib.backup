Of the six events found after excluding all interacting Type{\~{}}IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not be determined. All the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher star formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massive black hole. We compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},

abstract = {Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are transient events observed when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole to be tidally destroyed. Many TDE candidates have been discovered in host galaxies whose spectra have weak or no line emission yet strong Balmer line absorption, indicating a period of intense star formation that has recently ended. As such, TDE host galaxies fall into the rare class of quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies. Here, we quantify the fraction of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with spectral properties like those of TDE hosts, determining the extent to which TDEs are over-represented in such galaxies. Galaxies whose spectra have Balmer absorption {\{}{\{}H{\}}{\}}{\{}$\delta$ {\}}{\{}{\{}A{\}}{\}} - $\sigma$(H{\{}$\delta$ {\}}{\{}{\{}A{\}}{\}}) {\textgreater} 4 {\AA} (where $\sigma$(H{\{}$\delta$ {\}}{\{}{\{}A{\}}{\}}) is the error in the Lick {\{}{\{}H{\}}{\}}{\{}$\delta$ {\}}{\{}{\{}A{\}}{\}} index) and H$\alpha$ emission equivalent width (EW) {\textless} 3 {\AA} have had a strong starburst in the last ˜Gyr.

Thus, quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies are over-represented among the TDE hosts by a factor of 33-190. The high-energy-selected TDE Swift J1644 also lies in a galaxy with strong Balmer lines and weak H$\alpha$ emission, implying a $\backslash$gt 80×  enhancement in such hosts and providing an observational link between the $\gamma$/X-ray-bright and optical/UV-bright TDE classes.},

@article{Zabludoff1996,
abstract = {The spectrum of an "E + A" galaxy (Dressier {\&} Gunn) which is dominated by a young stellar component but lacks the emission lines characteristic of any significant, on-going star formation suggests that the galaxy experienced a brief, powerful starburst within the last gigayear (Dressler {\&} Gunn; Couch {\&} Sharples). In past work, this violent star formation history and the detection of these galaxies almost exclusively in distant clusters linked them to the Butcher-Oemler (B-O) effect (Butcher {\&} Oemler) and argued for the influence of cluster environment in the evolution of galaxies. However, no statistical survey of the environments of "E+A"s had ever been made. From 11,113 galaxy spectra in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (Shectman and coworkers), we have obtained a unique and well-defined sample of 21 nearby "E+A" galaxies with the same spectral characteristics as "E+A"s in distant clusters. These "E+A"s are selected to have the strongest Balmer absorption lines (the average of the equivalent widths of H$\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ is {\textgreater}5.5 A) and weakest [O II] emission-line equivalent widths ({\textless}2.5 A, which corresponds to a detection of [O II] of less than 2 $\sigma$ significance) of any of the galaxies in the survey. In contrast to inferences drawn from previous studies, we find that a large fraction (75{\%}) of nearby "E + A "s lie in the field, well outside of clusters and rich groups of galaxies. We conclude that interactions with the cluster environment, in the form of the intracluster medium or cluster potential, are not essential for "E+A" formation and therefore that the presence of these galaxies in distant clusters does not provide strong evidence for the effects of cluster environment on galaxy evolution. If one mechanism is responsible for "E+A" formation, then the observations that "E+A"s exist in the field and that at least five of the 21 in our sample have clear tidal features argue that galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers are that mechanism. The most likely environments for such mergers are poor groups of galaxies, which have lower velocity dispersions than clusters and higher galaxy densities than the field. Groups are correlated With rich clusters and, in hierarchical models, fall into clusters in greater numbers at intermediate redshifts than they do today (cf. Bower; Lacey {\&} Cole; Kauffmann). When combined with the strong evolution observed in the field population (cf. Broadhurst and coworkers; Lilly and coworkers), our work suggests that the B-O effect may reflect the typical evolution of galaxies in groups and in the field, rather than the influence of clusters on the star formation history of galaxies.},

Less than half of the blue galaxies cataloged by Butcher and Oemler in this cluster are actually cluster members. The color distribution in the cluster is not unusual when compared with nearby clusters of similar morphological type. On the other hand, the six blue objects that are members of 3C 295 are all very unusual for present-day clusters, including three galaxies with active nuclei and three galaxies which have evidence for large bursts of star formation.

@article{Bono2000,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the evolutionary properties of intermediate-mass stars. The evolutionary sequences were computed from the zero-age main sequence up to the central He exhaustion and often up to the phases that precede the carbon ignition or to the reignition of the H-shell, which marks the beginning of the thermal pulse phase. The evolutionary tracks were constructed by adopting a wide range of stellar masses (3<=M/Msolar <=15) and chemical compositions. In order to account for current uncertainties on the He to heavy elements enrichment ratio (?Y/?Z), the stellar models were computed by adopting at Z=0.02 two different He contents (Y=0.27, 0.289) and at Z=0.04 three different He contents (Y=0.29, 0.34, and 0.37). Moreover, to supply a homogeneous evolutionary scenario that accounts for young Magellanic stellar systems the calculations were also extended toward lower metallicities (Z=0.004, Z=0.01), by adopting different initial He abundances. We evaluated for both solar (Z=0.02) and super-metal-rich (SMR, Z=0.04) models the transition mass Mup between the stellar structures igniting carbon and those that develop a full electron degeneracy inside the carbon-oxygen core. We found that Mup is of the order of 7.7+/-0.5 Msolar for solar composition, while for SMR structures an increase in the He content causes a decrease in Mup, and indeed it changes from 9.5+/-0.5 Msolar at Y=0.29, to 8.7+/-0.2 Msolar at Y=0.34, and to 7.7+/-0.2 Msolar at Y=0.37. We also show that Mup presents a nonlinear behavior with metallicity, and indeed it decreases when moving from Z=0.04 to Z~0.001 and increases at lower metal contents. This finding confirms the predictions by Cassisi & Castellani and more recently by Umeda et al. and suggests that the rate of SNe type Ia depends on the chemical composition of the parent stellar population. This approach allows us to investigate in detail the evolutionary properties of classical Cepheids. In particular, we find that the range of stellar masses that perform the blue loop during the central He-burning phase narrows when moving toward metal-rich and SMR structures. This evidence and the substantial decrease in the evolutionary time spent by these structures inside the instability strip bring out that the probability of detecting long-period Cepheids in SMR stellar systems is substantially smaller than in more metal-poor systems. Moreover, and even more important, we find that the time spent by Cepheids along the subsequent crossings of the instability strip also depends on the stellar mass. In fact, our models suggest that low-mass, metal-poor Cepheids spend a substantial portion of their lifetime along the blueward excursion of the blue loop, while at higher masses (M/Msolar>=8) the time spent along the redward excursion becomes longer. Models at solar chemical composition present an opposite behavior, i.e., the time spent along the redward excursion is longer than the blueward excursion among low-mass Cepheids and vice versa for high-mass Cepheids. Oddly enough, the time spent along the blueward excursion is for models at Z=0.01 longer than the redward excursion over the entire mass range. This suggests a nonlinear dependence of crossing times on metallicity. The time spent along the first crossing of the instability strip is generally negligible with the exception of high-mass, metal-poor stellar structures for which it becomes of the order of 15\%-20\% of the total crossing time. },

abstract = {Supermassive black holes have powerful gravitational fields with strong gradients that can destroy stars that get too close, producing a bright flare in ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions from stellar debris that forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The aftermath of this process may have been seen several times over the past two decades in the form of sparsely sampled, slowly fading emission from distant galaxies, but the onset of the stellar disruption event has not hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of a bright X-ray flare from the extragalactic transient Swift J164449.3+573451. This source increased in brightness in the X-ray band by a factor of at least 10,000 since 1990 and by a factor of at least 100 since early 2010. We conclude that we have captured the onset of relativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole. A companion paper comes to similar conclusions on the basis of radio observations. This event is probably due to the tidal disruption of a star falling into a supermassive black hole, but the detailed behaviour differs from current theoretical models of such events.},

abstract = {The potential of tidal disruption of stars to probe otherwise quiescent supermassive black holes cannot be exploited, if their dynamics is not fully understood. So far, the observational appearance of these events has been derived from analytical extrapolations of the debris dynamical properties just after disruption. By means of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the subsequent fallback of the stream of debris towards the black hole for stars already bound to the black hole on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that the debris circularize due to relativistic apsidal precession which causes the stream to self-cross. The circularization time-scale varies between 1 and 10 times the period of the star, being shorter for more eccentric and/or deeper encounters. This self-crossing leads to the formation of shocks that increase the thermal energy of the debris. If this thermal energy is efficiently radiated away, the debris settle in a narrow ring at the circularization radius with shock-induced luminosities of ˜10-103 LEdd. If instead cooling is impeded, the debris form an extended torus located between the circularization radius and the semi-major axis of the star with heating rates ˜1-102 LEdd. Extrapolating our results to parabolic orbits, we infer that circularization would occur via the same mechanism in ˜1 period of the most bound debris for deeply penetrating encounters to ˜10 for grazing ones. We also anticipate the same effect of the cooling efficiency on the structure of the disc with associated luminosities of ˜1-10 LEdd and heating rates of ˜0.1-1 LEdd. In the latter case of inefficient cooling, we deduce a viscous time-scale generally shorter than the circularization time-scale. This suggests an accretion rate through the disc tracing the fallback rate, if viscosity starts acting promptly.},

These outbursts may result from the tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes, as well as accretion disk instabilities. In order to place the first reliable constraints on the rate of such outbursts in the universe and to test the stellar tidal disruption hypothesis, we have performed a systematic and complete survey for them by cross-correlating ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and pointed Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data. We have detected five galaxies that were in outburst during the RASS, three of which show no signs of nuclear activity; these objects had been reported on individually in previous studies. After making reasonable corrections for the complicated selection effects, we conclude that the rate of large-amplitude X-ray outbursts from inactive galaxies in the local universe is {\~{}}9.1×10-6 galaxy-1 yr-1. This rate is consistent with the predicted rate of stellar tidal disruption events in such galaxies. When only the two active galaxies are considered, we find a rate for active galaxies of {\~{}}8.5×10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1. In order to place tighter constraints on these rates, additional outbursts must be detected.},

@article{VanVelzen2013,
abstract = {Context. Many decades of observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries have shown that relativistic jets are ubiquitous when compact objects accrete. One could therefore anticipate the launch of a jet after a star is disrupted and accreted by a massive black hole. This birth of a relativistic jet may have been observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which were discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has been detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical to soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio frequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting, which reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing follow-up observation are mostly within {\~{}}10 months of the discovery, the non-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to the time of disruption.  Aims: We wish to test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets.  Methods: We present 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs, a significant increase of the number of radio observations of these events. To avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since the estimated time of disruption.  Results: None of the sources are detected, with very deep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the hypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. We also constrain the possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57, the first and best-sampled relativistic TDF.  Conclusions: We thus obtain evidence for a dichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying that the jet launching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.},

Our multi-wavelength follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived (duration {\textgreater}{\~{}} months), luminous X-ray (L X, iso ≈ 3 × 1047 erg s-1) and radio ($\nu$L $\nu$, iso ≈ 1042 erg s-1) counterpart. The associated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently discovered GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of tidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly collimated ($\theta$ {\textless} 1°) or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black hole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component. Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus (AGN)), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these sources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known classes of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies).},

@article{Svirski2015,
abstract = {Models for tidal disruption events (TDEs) in which a supermassive black hole disrupts a star commonly assume that the highly eccentric streams of bound stellar debris promptly form a circular accretion disk at the pericenter scale. However, the bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}44{\}}\backslash,\backslashrm{\{}erg\backslash,s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}, implies that we observe only {\$}\backslashsim1\backslash{\%}{\$} of the energy expected from accretion. Moreover, recent numerical simulations (Shiokawa et al. 2015) have shown that dissipation via hydrodynamical shocks is insufficient to circularize debris orbits on the pericenter scale, and the debris flow retains its initial semi-major axis scale throughout the first {\$}\backslashsim10{\$} orbits of the event. Motivated by these numerical results, Piran et al. (2015) suggested that the observed optical TDE emission is powered by shocks at the apocenter between freshly infalling material and earlier-arriving matter. This model explains the small radiated energy, the low temperature, and the large radius implied by the observations as well as the {\$}t{\^{}}{\{}-5/3{\}}{\$} light curve. However the question of the system's low efficiency remains unanswered. We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of the flow's highly eccentric orbits make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already small angular momentum to the point at which it can pass within the ISCO before these stresses remove enough energy to circularize the orbit. As a result, the typical efficiency is only {\$}\backslashsim3\backslash{\%}{\$} of a standard accretion disk's efficiency. Thus, the intrinsically high eccentricity of the tidal debris naturally explains why most TDE candidates are fainter than expected.},

@article{Lodato2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the arguments for the basis of the time evolution of the flares expected to arise when a star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole. We present a simple analytic model relating the light curve to the internal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard light curve proportional to t-5/3 only holds at late times. Close to the peak luminosity the light curve is shallower, deviating more strongly from t-5/3 for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar type) stars. We test our model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar models, described by simple polytropic spheres with index $\gamma$. The simulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First, the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective reduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well described by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the polytropic index becomes larger. Secondly, for large polytropic indices wings appear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material is pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In all our simulations, the t-5/3 light curve is achieved only at late stages. In particular, we predict that for solar-type stars, this happens only after the luminosity has dropped by at least 2mag from the peak. We discuss our results in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescent galaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, such as the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.},

Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found, potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to $\gamma$-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z ≈ 6.},

Here we report a luminous UV flare from an elliptical galaxy at z=0.37 in the Groth field of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey that has no evidence of a Seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging obtained during the flare. Multiwavelength data collected at the time of the event, and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for the first time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate tidal disruption flare from optical through X-rays.

abstract = {Using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in non-active galaxies. Two candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) are identified. The TDE flares have optical blackbody temperatures of 2 × 104 K and observed peak luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 ($\nu$L $\nu$ = 5 × 1042, 4 × 1043 erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates are very low, qualitatively consistent with expectations for tidal disruption flares. The properties of the TDE candidates are examined using (1) SDSS imaging to compare them to other flares observed in the search, (2) UV emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts and of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically identifiable AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over nine years provides strong evidence that these are not flares in hidden AGNs. The spectra and color evolution of the flares are unlike any SN observed to date, their strong late-time UV emission is particularly distinctive, and they are nuclear at high resolution arguing against these being first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or more extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN or an AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new process specific to the inner few hundred parsecs of non-active galaxies cannot be excluded. Based on our observed rate, we infer that hundreds or thousands of TDEs will be present in current and next-generation optical synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using geometric resolution and host and flare color alone, demonstrating that a campaign to create a large sample of TDEs, with immediate and detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of this work is quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares in AGNs.},

Recently, two 'relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.},

abstract = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by Galaxy Evolution Explorer with coordinated observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an early type galaxy at redshift z = 0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or active galactic nucleus activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power the observed luminosity is only {\~{}}0.002 M ⊙, which points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition, the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature. Three deep non-detections in the radio with the Very Large Array over the first two years after the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.},

abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star's matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, and the other half is unbound. To form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole's gravitational radius (˜ {\{}{\{}10{\}}51{\}}{\{}{\{}(R/1000{\{}{\{}R{\}}g{\}}){\}}-1{\}} erg).

abstract = {Was PS1-10jh, an optical/ultraviolet transient discovered by the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey, the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole (BH)? We address two aspects of the problem: the composition of the putative disrupted object (using the spectroscopic data), and the energetics of the observed gas and radiation (using the photometric data). We perform photoionization calculations and compare with the observed lower limit of the line ratio L{\_}{\{}He II 4686{\}}/L{\_}{\{}H$\alpha$ {\}}{\textgreater}5 to argue that this event was not the disruption of a solar-type star, and instead was likely the disruption of a helium core (as first proposed by Gezari et al.). Disruption of such a dense object requires a relatively small central BH, MBH ≲ 2 × 105 M⊙. We use the photometric data to infer that PS1-10jh comprised an outflow of ˜0.01 M⊙ of gas, escaping from the BH at ˜1000 km s-1, and we propose that this outflow was driven primarily by radiation pressure trapped by Thomson and resonance line scattering. The large ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy, Erad/EK ˜ 104, together with the large value of Erad ˜ 2 × 1051 erg, suggests that the outflow was shocked at large radius (perhaps similar to superluminous supernovae or the internal shock model for gamma-ray bursts). We describe puzzles in the physics of PS1-10jh, and discuss how this event may help us understand future tidal disruptions and super-Eddington accretion events as well.},

abstract = {Rates of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) due to two-body relaxation are calculated using a large galaxy sample (N ≈ 200) in order to explore the sensitivity of the TDE rates to observational uncertainties, such as the parametrization of galaxy light profiles and the stellar mass function. The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly constrained occupation fraction of SMBHs in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise dominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical surveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for several physically motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington luminosities (such as disc winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis relativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly constrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much less pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a volume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample of TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects, already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our most conservative rate estimates appear to be in tension with much lower observationally inferred TDE rates, and we discuss several possible resolutions to this discrepancy.},

The source had a peak bolometric luminosity of L ≃ 1044 erg s-1 and a total integrated energy of E ≃ 7 × 1050 erg radiated over the ˜6 months of observations presented. The UV/optical emission of the source is well fitted by a blackbody with roughly constant temperature of T ˜ 35 000 K, while the luminosity declines by roughly a factor of 16 over this time. The optical/UV luminosity decline is broadly consistent with an exponential decline, L∝ e{\^{}}{\{}-t/t{\_}0{\}}, with t0 ≃ 60 d. ASASSN-14li also exhibits soft X-ray emission comparable in luminosity to the optical and UV emission but declining at a slower rate, and the X-ray emission now dominates. Spectra of the source show broad Balmer and helium lines in emission as well as strong blue continuum emission at all epochs. We use the discoveries of ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae to estimate the TDE rate implied by ASAS-SN, finding an average rate of r ≃ 4.1 × 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy with a 90 per cent confidence interval of (2.2-17.0) × 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy. ASAS-SN found roughly 1 TDE for every 70 Type Ia supernovae in 2014, a rate that is much higher than that of other surveys.},

@article{Roth2015,
abstract = {Observations of luminous flares resulting from the possible tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes have raised a number of puzzles. Outstanding questions include the origin of the optical and ultraviolet (UV) flux, the weakness of hydrogen lines in the spectrum, and the occasional simultaneous observation of x-rays. Here we study the emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion propagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar debris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation, and present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak brightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a non local thermodynamic equilibrium treatment of the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen, helium and oxygen (as a representative metal). Our calculations show how an extended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft x-rays and produce the observed optical fluxes of order 10{\^{}}43 ergs per second. Variations in the mass or size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time with roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, x-rays can highly ionize the reprocessing region and escape to be observed simultaneously with the optical flux, producing an SED not described by a single blackbody. Due to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly suppressed relative to helium line emission (with HeII-to-H line ratios of at least 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We discuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars destroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the observed flares.},

abstract = {We present observations of Swift J1112.2-8238, and identify it as a candidate relativistic tidal disruption flare. The outburst was first detected by Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in 2011 June as an unknown, long-lived (order of days) gamma-ray transient source. We show that its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint galaxy for which we establish a likely redshift of z = 0.89 based on a single emission line that we interpret as the blended [O II] $\lambda$3727 doublet. At this redshift, the peak X-ray/gamma-ray luminosity exceeded 1047 erg s-1, while a spatially coincident optical transient source had i' ˜ 22 (Mg ˜ -21.4 at z = 0.89) during early observations, ˜20 d after the Swift trigger. These properties place Swift J1112.2-8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the two previously identified members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+0516. As with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence for variability over the first few days, while late-time observations, almost 3 yr post-outburst, demonstrate that it has now switched off. Swift J1112.2-8238 brings the total number of such events observed by Swift to three, interestingly all detected by Swift over a ˜3 month period ({\textless}3 per cent of its total lifetime as of 2015 March). While this suggests the possibility that further examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the BAT archives, the lack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events are undoubtedly rare.},

abstract = {When a star comes within a critical distance to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), immense tidal forces disrupt the star, resulting in a stream of debris that falls back onto the SMBH and powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a main-sequence star by an SMBH to characterize the evolution of the debris stream after a tidal disruption. We demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravity in the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star's travel and as a consequence has a negligible surface area and makes almost no contribution to either the continuum or line emission. We therefore propose that any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in this unbound debris, but are produced in the region above and below the forming elliptical accretion disk, analogous to the broad-line region (BLR) in steadily accreting active galactic nuclei. As each line within a BLR is observationally linked to a particular location in the accretion disk, we suggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion disk does not yet extend to the distance required to produce that line. This model can be used to understand the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event PS1-10jh, for which He II lines are observed, but the Balmer series and He I are not. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we show that the disruption of a main-sequence star of near-solar composition can reproduce this event.},

@article{Hayasaki2015,
abstract = {We study the circularization of tidally disrupted stars on bound orbits around spinning supermassive black holes by performing three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with Post-Newtonian corrections. Our simulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the efficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization if radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams self-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the intersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a geometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring rapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a geometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is efficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and forms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated energy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the subsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to {\~{}}2*10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10{\^{}}6 Msun black hole. We also find that a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced circularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning black hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably long in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black hole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important nodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the other hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in the radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our simulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar tidal disruptions.},

@article{Esquej2007,
abstract = {Context: In recent years, giant amplitude X-ray flares have been observed from a handful of non-active galaxies. The most plausible scenario of these unusual phenomena is tidal disruption of a star by a quiescent supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy.  Aims: Only a small number of these type of events have been observed and confirmed to date. The discovery of more cases would allow a number of fundamental conclusions to be drawn about properties such as the frequency of tidal disruption events, the distribution of quiescent black hole masses and their influence in the context of galaxy/AGN formation and evolution among others.  Methods: Comparing the XMM-Newton Slew Survey Source Catalogue with the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey five galaxies have been detected a factor of up to 88 brighter in XMM-Newton with respect to ROSAT PSPC upper limits and presenting a soft X-ray colour. X-ray luminosities of these sources derived from slew observations have been found in the range 1041{\{}-{\}}1044 erg s-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. This model predicts that during the peak of the outburst, flares reach X-ray luminosities up to 1045 erg s-1, which is close to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, and afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to years is expected. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations have been performed on these highly variable objects in order to disentangle their nature and to investigate their dynamical evolution.  Results: Here we present sources coming from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey that could fit in the paradigm of tidal disruption events. X-ray and optical observations revealed that two of these objects are in full agreement with that scenario and three other sources that, showing signs of optical activity, need further investigation within the transient galactic nuclei phenomena.},
