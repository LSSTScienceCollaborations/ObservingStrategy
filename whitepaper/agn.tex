\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:\chpname:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

This chapter discusses the potential effects of the LSST observing
strategy on AGN science. In short, there appears to be a consensus
among the AGN and galaxies communities that AGN science will benefit
from the most uniform cadence in terms of even sampling for each band
and uniform sky coverage. It is also expected that any reasonable
perturbation to the nominal LSST observing strategy will have mostly
minor effects on AGN science. This chapter attempts to identify all
the areas of AGN science that may be affected by the observing strategy
and to point out the metrics that can be used to quantify any potential
effect. Since the total number of metrics that can be quantified is
quite large, and the effects are likely small in most cases, the goal
of this chapter is to identify potential ``show stoppers'' that may undermine
key AGN research areas. For example, certain perturbations may reduce
significantly the number of ``interesting'' AGNs, such as $z>6$ quasars,
lensed quasars, or transient AGNs. Another example is photometric
reverberation mapping which is one of LSST's greatest advantages for
AGN research but is also very sensitive to the cadence; care must be
taken to ensure that the observing strategy does not undermine the
ability to make the best use of this method.

Note: Transient AGN and tidal disruption events are discussed in
detail in the transients chapter
(\autoref{chp:transients}), while gravitationally-lensed AGN are
covered in the cosmology chapter (\autoref{sec:lenstimedelays}).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

% Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
% made to improve the figures of merit, and mitigate the identified risks?
% What ``tweaks'', if any, can be proposed to the nominal LSST observing strategy
% in order to help achieve key AGN science goals?

%Some additional considerations/thoughts that came up during the Bremerton
%workshop:

The goals of this Chapter are 1) to define and quantify key metrics for AGN
science that can be measured and tested using the current LSST observing
strategy, and 2) to identify reasonable perturbations that may be beneficial
for AGN science.
%
Each of those metrics can be regarded as an individual science project
that can make a case for a cadence perturbation.
%
Undoubtedly, additional work is required to refine many of these mterics
and perform more rigorous tests and simulations.
%
The following list identifies the main areas where more work is required,
as well as additional cadence-related aspects for further consideration.
This may be regarded as a road map for further investigations that should
be carried out during the planning stage:

1) Assuming a total of DDFs, it would be beneficial if one of those fields
could be sampled more heavily than the others and would be visited nightly (or
even more frequently, e.g., from $\sim1$ to $\sim1000$ min) per band.
This can be justified by the fact that a) very few AGNs have been monitored
at these frequencies on such a long baseline, leaving room for discovery,
and b) this may probe intermediate-mass black holes
($\sim10^4 - 10^5$~$M_{\odot}$) via PRM or
PSDs. Good candidate fields are the Magellanic Clouds and the
Chandra Deep Field-South. An observational strategy should be developed
and implemented either in a new OpSim, or during commissioning.

2) An assessment of the effects of the LSST cadence on the ability to
detect periodic AGNs and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGNs
should be performed.

3) In order to have more informative metrics, accurate model light
curves are needed that can reproduce how the fiducial light
curves appear in different bands, at different inherent luminosities,
and at different redshifts. This may be developed together with the
Strong Lensing Science Collaboration.

4) There is a need to compare the science content in this Chapter
with the AGN chapter in the LSST Science Book as well as with the
Ivezic et al. overview paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.2366v4.pdf)
to ensure that no key science aspect is overlooked or compromised
by the nominal cadence.
%}

%\todo{}{Compare the $Y$-band (and other bands) depths, single
%epoch and final co-added, from  enigma\_1189 with other OpSims.}

%\todo{}{Assess the effect of non-simultaneous colors on AGN selection.}

%\todo{}{Based on the current OpSim, need to specify the magnitude limits
%at the highest airmass and assess the limitations of the DCR method in
%the $L-z$ plane. Should check this with MAF and if indeed AM <= 1.4, need
%to add a request in:
%https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/tree/master/opsim
%}

%\todo{}{Assess whether, e.g., a pair of $\sim2.5$ min exposures (i.e., $\sim10$
%times longer than the standard exposures) at airmass $\sim2$ would get deep
%enough for useful DCR constraints for a large fraction of the AGNs. This may
%be a non-negligible perturbation of the expected 56-184 visits per band, and
%may even be impossible given current upper limits on exposure times, but
%this would help improve photo-z's for galaxies and SNe too.}

%\todo{}{For PRM and microlensing: obtain distributions (mean and dispersion)
%of the number of visits, per band, across the sky for the nominal OpSim
%(during the entire survey).}

%\todo{}{
5) It is worth checking whether
%Add a discussion about blazars and LSST cadence (e.g., Isler+15?). Would
any aspect of blazar science might be compromised by the nominal cadence, or
would benefit from a specific cadence requirement.
%}

%\todo{}{
6) The effects of the cadence on the overall LSST astrometry accuracy and precision
should be assessed in terms of potential effects on AGN selection. For example,
AGN selection may benefit from very good depth at least in the 1st and 10th year of the
survey.
%}

%\todo{}{
7) It is necessary to identify the frequency range and sampling for obtaining
optimal PSDs required for QPO detection (given $M_{\rm BH}$, spin, and $L/L_{\rm Edd}$).
Based on the nominal cadence, it is necessary to assess the potential of discovering
QPOs in the main survey and in the DDFs.
