\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{~~~~~~~~~Summary}

To zeroth order, AGN science with LSST will benefit from the most
uniform cadence in terms of even sampling for each band and uniform sky
coverage while maximizing the area, but excluding the Galactic plane. It
is also expected that any reasonable perturbation to the nominal LSST
observing strategy will not have a major effect on AGN science. While
denser sampling at shorter wavelengths will aid investigations of the
size and structure of the AGN central engine via intrinsic continuum
variability and microlensing, care must be taken not to compromise the
coadded $Y$-band depth which is crucial for detecting the most distant
quasars. Assuming two visits per night, two different bands are
preferred. Science cases related to intrinsic continuum and
broad-emission line variability will benefit from the denser sampling
offered in the DDFs. These fields will provide powerful ``truth tables''
that are crucial for AGN selection algorithms, enable construction of
high-quality power spectral density functions, and enable measurements
of continuum-continuum and line-continuum time lags. The benefits and
tradeoffs with respect to the main survey involve high-quality light
curves but for only a small fraction ($\sim1$\%) of all sources,
preferentially those at lower luminosities. Certain science cases will
benefit greatly from even denser sampling, i.e., $\sim1 -
1000$~d$^{-1}$, of a smaller area, perhaps during the commissioning
phase, as long as the temporal baseline will extend over the ten years
of the project. Another justification to this strategy is the fact that
very few AGNs, or transient AGNs, have been monitored at these
frequencies on such a long baseline, leaving room for discovery.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:\chpname:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

The purpose of this chapter is to identify AGN science cases that may be
affected by the LSST observing strategy and to specify the metrics that can be
used to quantify any potential effects. Since the total number of metrics that
can be quantified is quite large, and the potential effects are not likely to be
significant in most cases, the goal of this chapter is to identify potential
``show stoppers'' that may undermine key AGN research areas. For example,
certain perturbations may reduce significantly the number of ``interesting'' AGNs,
such as $z > 6$ quasars, lensed quasars, or transient AGNs. Another example is
photometric reverberation mapping which is one of LSST's greatest potential
advantages for AGN research but is also very sensitive to the cadence; care must
be taken to ensure that the observing strategy does not undermine the ability to
make the best use of this method.

%This chapter discusses the potential effects of the LSST observing
%strategy on AGN science. In short, there appears to be a consensus
%among the AGN and galaxies communities that AGN science will benefit
%from the most uniform cadence in terms of even sampling for each band
%and uniform sky coverage. It is also expected that any reasonable
%perturbation to the nominal LSST observing strategy will not have a major
%effect on AGN science. This chapter attempts to identify all
%the areas of AGN science that may be affected by the observing strategy
%and to point out the metrics that can be used to quantify any potential
%effects. Since the total number of metrics that can be quantified is
%quite large, and the potential effects are not likely to be significant in
%most cases, the goal of this chapter is to identify potential ``show
%stoppers'' that may undermine key AGN research areas. For example, certain
%perturbations may reduce significantly the number of ``interesting'' AGNs,
%such as $z>6$ quasars, lensed quasars, or transient AGNs. Another example
%is photometric reverberation mapping which is one of LSST's greatest
%potential advantages for AGN research but is also very sensitive to the
%cadence; care must be taken to ensure that the observing strategy does
%not undermine the ability to make the best use of this method.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:AGNCensus}
describes potential effects the LSST Observing Strategy may have on the
selection of LSST AGNs in the entire survey, hereafter, the AGN
census. Subsamples of this census are then used throughout this chapter for
discussing particular science cases. Section~\ref{sec:AGNContinuum}
discusses potential effects of the Observing Strategy on studying AGN continuum
(or disk) variability. Section~\ref{sec:AGNMicrolensing} describes how the
LSST cadence may affect estimates or constraints on the size and structure of
the AGN central engine from observations of microlensing events.
Section~\ref{sec:AGNFuture} presents science cases that are still being
developed quantitatively, including sampling effects on measurements related
to the broad emission line region in AGNs. Finally,
section~\ref{sec:AGNDiscussion} discusses additional AGN science aspects that
may be affected significantly by the LSST cadence.

Note: Transient AGN and tidal disruption events are discussed in
detail in the transients chapter
(\autoref{chp:transients}), while gravitationally-lensed AGN are
covered in the cosmology chapter (\autoref{sec:lenstimedelays}).

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:AGNDiscussion}
\label{sec:\chpname:discussion}

%Some additional considerations/thoughts that came up during the Bremerton
%workshop:

The goals of this Chapter were 1) to define and quantify key metrics for AGN
science that can be measured and tested using the current LSST observing
strategy, and 2) to identify reasonable perturbations that may be beneficial
for AGN science.
%
Undoubtedly, additional work is required to refine many of these metrics
and perform more rigorous tests and simulations.
%
The following list identifies additional cadence-related aspects for further
consideration. Together with the metrics discussed in this Chapter, this may
be regarded as a road map for further investigations that should be performed
during the planning stage.

1) Assuming a total of ten DDFs, it would be beneficial if one of those fields
could be sampled more heavily than the others and would be visited nightly (or
even more frequently, e.g., from $\sim1$ to $\sim1000$ min) per band.
This can be justified by the fact that a) very few AGNs or transient AGNs have
been monitored at these frequencies on such a long baseline, leaving room for
discovery, and b) this may probe intermediate-mass black holes
($\sim10^4 - 10^5$~$M_{\odot}$) via PRM or PSDs. Good candidate fields are
the Magellanic Clouds and the Chandra Deep Field-South. An observational
strategy should be developed and implemented either in a new OpSim, or
during commissioning.

%2) An assessment of the effects of the LSST cadence on the ability to
%detect periodic AGNs and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGNs
%should be performed.

2) In order to have more informative metrics, accurate model light
curves are needed that can reproduce fiducial light curves in different
bands, at different inherent luminosities, and at different redshifts.
This may be developed together with the Strong Lensing Science Collaboration.

%\todo{}{
3) There is a need to compare the science content in this Chapter
with the AGN chapter in the LSST Science Book as well as with the
Ivezic et al. overview paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.2366v4.pdf)
to ensure that no key science aspect is overlooked or compromised
by the nominal cadence.
%}

%\todo{}{Compare the $Y$-band (and other bands) depths, single
%epoch and final co-added, from  enigma\_1189 with other OpSims.}

%\todo{}{Assess the effect of non-simultaneous colors on AGN selection.}

%\todo{}{Based on the current OpSim, need to specify the magnitude limits
%at the highest airmass and assess the limitations of the DCR method in
%the $L-z$ plane. Should check this with MAF and if indeed AM <= 1.4, need
%to add a request in:
%https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/tree/master/opsim
%}

%\todo{}{Assess whether, e.g., a pair of $\sim2.5$ min exposures (i.e., $\sim10$
%times longer than the standard exposures) at airmass $\sim2$ would get deep
%enough for useful DCR constraints for a large fraction of the AGNs. This may
%be a non-negligible perturbation of the expected 56-184 visits per band, and
%may even be impossible given current upper limits on exposure times, but
%this would help improve photo-z's for galaxies and SNe too.}

%\todo{}{For PRM and microlensing: obtain distributions (mean and dispersion)
%of the number of visits, per band, across the sky for the nominal OpSim
%(during the entire survey).}

%\todo{}{
4) It is worth checking whether
%Add a discussion about blazars and LSST cadence (e.g., Isler+15?). Would
any aspect of blazar science might be compromised by the nominal cadence, or
would benefit from a specific cadence requirement.
%}

%\todo{}{
5) The effects of the cadence on the overall LSST astrometry accuracy and precision
should be assessed in terms of potential effects on AGN selection. For example,
AGN selection may benefit from very good depth at least in the 1st and 10th year of the
survey.
%}

%\todo{}{
%6) It is necessary to identify the frequency range and sampling for obtaining
%optimal PSDs required for QPO detection (given $M_{\rm BH}$, spin, and $L/L_{\rm Edd}$).
%Based on the nominal cadence, it is necessary to assess the potential of discovering
%QPOs in the main survey and in the DDFs.
