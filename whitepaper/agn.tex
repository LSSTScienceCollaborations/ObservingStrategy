\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:\chpname:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

This chapter discusses the potential effects of the LSST observing
strategy on AGN science. In short, there appears to be a consensus
among the AGN and galaxies communities that AGN science will benefit
from the most uniform cadence in terms of even sampling for each band
and uniform sky coverage. It is also expected that any reasonable
perturbation to the nominal LSST observing strategy will have mostly
minor effects on AGN science. This chapter attempts to identify all
the areas of AGN science that may be affected by the observing strategy
and to point out the metrics that can be used to quantify any potential
effect. Since the total number of metrics that can be quantified is
quite large, and the effects are likely small in most cases, the goal
of this chapter is to identify potential ``show stoppers'' that may undermine
key AGN research areas. For example, certain perturbations may reduce
significantly the number of ``interesting'' AGNs, such as $z>6$ quasars,
lensed quasars, or transient AGNs. Another example is photometric
reverberation mapping which is one of LSST's greatest advantages for
AGN research but is also very sensitive to the cadence; care must be
taken to ensure that the observing strategy does not undermine the
ability to make the best use of this method.

Note: Transient AGN and tidal disruption events are discussed in
detail in the transients chapter
(\autoref{chp:transients}), while gravitationally-lensed AGN are
covered in the cosmology chapter (\autoref{sec:lenstimedelays}).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

% Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
% made to improve the figures of merit, and mitigate the identified risks?
% What ``tweaks'', if any, can be proposed to the nominal LSST observing strategy
% in order to help achieve key AGN science goals?

Some additional considerations/thoughts that came up during the Bremerton
workshop:

1) Assuming we will have 10 DDFs, perhaps one of those fields could be
sampled more heavily than the others and would be visited nightly (or
even more frequently, e.g., from $\sim1$ to $\sim1000$ min) per band.
This can be justified by the fact that
a) very few AGNs have been monitored at these frequencies on such a
long baseline, leaving room for discovery, and b) this may probe
intermediate-mass black holes ($\sim10^4 - 10^5$~$M_{\odot}$) via PRM or
PSDs. Good candidate fields are the CDF-S and the MCs.
Need to suggest a strategy for an OpSim (or commissioning).

2) Need to assess the effects of the LSST cadence on the ability to
detect periodic AGNs and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGNs.

3) Needs from OpSim: in order to have informative metrics, we need to have
accurate model light curves that can reproduce how the fiducial light
curves appear in different bands, at different inherent luminosities,
and at different redshifts.

\todo{}{Compare the current science content with the AGN chapter in the
Science Book as well as with the Ivezic et al. overview paper
(http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.2366v4.pdf).}

%\todo{}{Compare the $Y$-band (and other bands) depths, single
%epoch and final co-added, from  enigma\_1189 with other OpSims.}

%\todo{}{Assess the effect of non-simultaneous colors on AGN selection.}

%\todo{}{Based on the current OpSim, need to specify the magnitude limits
%at the highest airmass and assess the limitations of the DCR method in
%the $L-z$ plane. Should check this with MAF and if indeed AM <= 1.4, need
%to add a request in:
%https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/tree/master/opsim
%}

%\todo{}{Assess whether, e.g., a pair of $\sim2.5$ min exposures (i.e., $\sim10$
%times longer than the standard exposures) at airmass $\sim2$ would get deep
%enough for useful DCR constraints for a large fraction of the AGNs. This may
%be a non-negligible perturbation of the expected 56-184 visits per band, and
%may even be impossible given current upper limits on exposure times, but
%this would help improve photo-z's for galaxies and SNe too.}

\todo{}{For PRM and microlensing: obtain distributions (mean and dispersion)
of the number of visits, per band, across the sky for the nominal OpSim
(during the entire survey).}

\todo{}{Add a discussion about blazars and LSST cadence (e.g., Isler+15?).
Would blazar science benefit from a specific cadence requirement?}

\todo{}{Check the Astrometry chapter and assess the astrometric precision
for AGN selection. For example, we may require very good depth at least in
the 1st and 10th year of the survey.}

\todo{}{Indicate the properties (frequency range and sampling) for obtaining
optimal PSDs required for QPO detection (given MBH, spin, and L/LEdd). Based on
current OpSim, assess the potential of discovering QPOs in the main survey
and in the DDFs.}
