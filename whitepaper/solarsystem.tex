\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:\chpname:intro}

LSST has tremendous potential as a discovery and characterization tool
for small bodies in the Solar System. With LSST, we have the
opportunity to increase our sample sizes of Potentially Hazardous
Asteroids (PHAs), Near Earth Objects (NEOs), Main Belt Asteroids
(MBAs), Jupiter Trojans, Centaurs, Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs),
Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs), comets and other small body populations
such as Earth mini-moons, irregular satellites, and other planetary
Trojan populations, by at least an order of
magnitude, often two orders of magnitude or more. In addition to
hundreds of astrometric measurements for most objects, LSST will also
provide precisely calibrated multiband photometry. With this
information, we can also characterize these populations -- deriving
colors, light curves, rotation periods, spin states, and even shape
models where possible.

The motivation behind studying these small body populations is
fundamentally to understand planet formation and evolution. The
orbital parameters of these populations record traces of the orbital
evolution of the giant planets. The migration of Jupiter, Saturn and
Neptune in particular have left marks on the orbital distribution of
MBAs, Jupiter Trojans, TNOs and SDOs. Rapid migration of
Jupiter and Saturn may have emplaced a large number of planetesimals
in the Scattered Disk; later slow migration of Neptune will affect the
number of TNOs in resonance and the details of their orbital parameters
within the resonance. Adding color information provides further
insights; colors roughly track composition, indicating formation
location and temperature or space weathering history. For example, the color
gradient of main belt asteroids, combined with their orbital
distribution, suggests that perhaps Jupiter migrated inwards,
mixing planetesimals from the outer Solar System into the outer parts
of the main belt, before eventually migrating outwards. Studying the
size distribution of each of the small body populations themselves
provides more constraints on planetesimal formation; this is
complicated by the effects of dynamical stirring from the giant
planets, which can increase the rate of erosion vs.\ growth during
collisions, and by the existence of the remnants of collisions such as
collisional families in the main belt. The presence of binaries and range
of spin states and shapes provides further constraints on the history
of each population. The location
of the planets before migration, the amount of migration, and the size
distribution of the small bodies themselves (after detangling the
dynamical evolution) all tell a deeper story about how the planets in
the Solar System formed, and how our formation history fits into the
range of observed extrasolar planetary systems.

These Solar System populations are unique when compared to other
objects which will be investigated by LSST, due to the simple fact
that they move across the sky. Metrics to evaluate
LSST's performance for moving objects need to be based on `per object'
measurements, rather than at a series of points on the sky or per
field pointing. For all metrics discussed in this chapter, the orbit
of each object is integrated over the time of the simulated opsim
survey and the detections of each object are recorded (using the
footprint of the focal plane and including
trailing losses and adjusting for the colors of the objects in each
filter to generate SNR and likelihood of detection); these
series of observations per object are then the basis for metric
evaluations.
