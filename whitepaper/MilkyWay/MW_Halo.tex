\section{Mapping the Milky Way Halo}
\def\secname{MW_Halo}\label{sec:\secname} % For example, replace "keyword" with "lenstimedelays"

The study of the Halo of the Milky Way is of the most importance not only to understand
the formation and early evolution of our own galaxy, but also to test 
test current models of hierarchical galaxy formation. 
LSST will provide an unprecedented combination of
area, depth, multi-band, multi-epoch information for pursuing detail studies
of the structure of this old Galactic component. We focus here in three
specific projects that can be pursued with LSST. We define metrics that can
be calculated in order to quantify the feasibility of the projects under different 
observational strategies. We expect more projects will join later.

RR Lyrae stars have been known for several decades as excellent tracers
of the halo population. They are not only old stars ($>10$ Gyrs) but they are
also excellent standard candles that allow to build 3-dimensional maps. 
The halo of the Milky Way has been now surveyed in a very large extension up to 
$\sim 60-80$ kpc from the Galactic center (refs). Beyond that, the halo is
mostly uncharted territory.
From these RR Lyrae surveys, we have learned that the halo is filled with substructures
which are usually interpreted as debris from destroyed satellite galaxies. The smooth 
component of the RR Lyrae distribution is well described
with a power-law of the mean number density of RR Lyrae stars as a function of
galactocentric distance, which gets steeper after $\sim 30$ kpc (refs). 
Thus, beyond $\sim 60$ kpc, few field RR Lyrae stars are expected. However, we expect that 
any RR Lyrae star beyond this distance may be part of either debris material or distant
satellite galaxies of low luminosity that have been escaped detection until now (refs). 
LCDM models predict debris as far as XXX kpc from the galactic center
This is the territory that will be explored by LSST.

Similarly, red giant stars can be used to trace the structure of the halo up to large
distances. They have the advantage 
of being bright and numerous stars. COLIN, PLEASE STEP IN HERE.

Fainter than these two tracers, main sequence stars stand up as a tool for studying
the Halo. They are the most numerous type of stars available and statistical studies 
are possible. Using the technique of photometric metallicities (Ivezic et al 2008), 
SDSS provided unprecedented maps of the metallicity distribution up to  $\sim 10$ 
kpc from the Galactic center, unveiling not only the mean metallicity distribution 
of the halo but also, sub-structures within the halo. This kind of works will be extended
to the outermost parts of the Galaxy with LSST data.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:keyword:MW_Halo_targets}

The three projects just described require the discovery and/or measurement of the following 
type of objects:

\bullet RR Lyrae stars: These are bright horizontal-branch variable stars with
periods between 0.2 to 1.0 days and large amplitudes, particularly in the bluer 
bandpasses (g amplitudes = XX to XX). Optimal use of LSST for discovering
RR Lyraes involves the simultaneous use of multi-band time series (refs).
Chapter XX discusses with details the discovery metrics for RR Lyrae stars.
A particularly valuable measurement for studies in the halo is the infrared mean
magnitudes z and Y since they provide the most accurate way to obtain 
distances.

\bullet Red Giants: red giants needs to be identified and separated from the 
very numerous red main sequence stars present in the field. A gravity-sensitive
photometric index can be used for separating efficiently giants from dwarfs (refs).
The u magnitude is an essential ingredient in this process and it is necessary to
follow-up the behavior of the u limiting magnitude under different observational strategies.

\bullet Photometric Metallicities: For this project it is necessary to measure ugr photometry 
for main sequence stars. At faint magnitudes, star/galaxy separation is an issue that needs
to be addressed.

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:keyword:MW_Halo_metrics}

Quantifying the response via MAF metrics: definition of the metrics,
and any derived overall figure of merit.

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:keyword:MW_Halo_analysis}

OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
the time of writing for this science project?

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:keyword:MW_Halo_discussion}

Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
the identified risks?
