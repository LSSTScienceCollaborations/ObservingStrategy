\section{Star Formation History of the Milky Way}

\noindent{\it Author Name(s)} % (Writing team)

% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

Summary: this important topic does not seem to have been developed in
previous versions of the LSST science book or Ivezic et
al. (2008). LSST gives the opportunity to survey extensive areas
around star formation regions in the Southern hemisphere. Among
others, it would allow to study the Initial Mass Function down to the
sub-stellar limit across different environments. Young stars are
efficiently identified by their variability.

A short preamble goes here. What's the context for this science
project? Where does it fit in the big picture?

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:keyword:targets}

In order to assess the ability of LSST to 1) identify and 2) classify
YSO we need to quantify the variability timescales and amplitudes of
both Class I/II (stars with disks) and Class III (WTTS). Inclusion of
eruptive variables (FUor/Exor) is appropriate as well - see section
8.10.2 in the Science Book.

In brief, WTTS are quasi-periodic with amplitudes of 0.1 to 0.3 mag
and periods 1 to ~15 days - so comparable to gamma Dor stars (see
Figure 8.17 in the SB). Given the temporal evolution of cool spots, a
period recovery analysis such as shown for RRL stars (se FIgure 8.20
in the SB) is likely difficult. The embedded systems and CTTS are
irregular variables but shown have distinctive colors due to
extinction + UB/blue excess arising from to accretion shocks.


%Describe the discoveries and measurements you want to make.

%Now, describe their response to the observing strategy. Qualitatively,
%how will the science project be affected by the observing schedule and
%conditions? In broad terms, how would we expect the observing strategy
%to be optimized for this science?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:keyword:metrics}

Quantifying the response via MAF metrics: definition of the metrics,
and any derived overall figure of merit.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:keyword:analysis}

OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
the time of writing for this science project?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:keyword:discussion}

Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
the identified risks?
