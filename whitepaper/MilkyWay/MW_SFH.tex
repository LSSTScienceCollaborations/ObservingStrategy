% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

LSST gives the opportunity to survey extensive areas
around star formation regions in the Southern hemisphere. Among
others, it would allow to study the Initial Mass Function down to the
sub-stellar limit across different environments. Young stars are
efficiently identified by their variability.

Section 8.10.2 in the LSST Science Book (p298--299) provides a
  thorough scientific motivation for the characterization of young
  stars through variability, including discussion of the observational
  signatures of the diverse physical phenomena driving observed time
  variability. The general observable is strong, irregular flaring
  across the entire $ugrizy$~bandpass of LSST. Flaring can last from
  minutes to years, and at amplitudes from a few tenths to several
  magnitudes.

% WIC - the following para has been removed since it's already present
% verbatim at the end of Section 8.10.2 in the LSST Science Book.

%LSST will increase the sample size for detailed follow-up observations
%due its ability to survey star formations at large heliocentric
%distances and to detect variability in embedded and highly extincted
%young objects that would otherwise be missed in shallower
%surveys. During its operations LSST will also provide statistics on
%the durations of high states, for at least one important tracer
%population (the shorter-duration EXor variables).

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

The nature of the variability in young stars changes with evolutionary
status. For the youngest stars still undergoing significant mass
accretion, FU Orionis and related outbursts can occur due to
circumstellar disk instabilities. As the natal environment dissipates
and the accretion rates drops, the stars take on a Classical T Tauri
appearance where the variability is primarily due to changes in the
accretion flow and rotational modulation of hot spots resulting from
accretion shocks on the protostellar photosphere. Also present are the
signature of cool spots arising from strong magnetic fields. This cool
spot rotational modulation is responsible for the variability in the
disk-less, and older, weak-line T Tauri stars.

Of particular interest are the FUor and EXor variables, which are
  named after the prototype objects FU Orionis \citep{hartmann96}
  and EX Lupi \citep{herbig01} respectively, and for which
  only a relatively small number of examples are known. In these
  pre-main sequence objects, eruptive outbursts of up to 6 magnitudes
  have been observed, with high state durations from years to
  decades. In addition to triggering follow-up observations, LSST
  should be able to set the first population constraints on the
  duration of high states, particularly for the short end of the
  timescale distribution for these eruptive variables.

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

In order to assess the ability of LSST to 1) identify and 2) classify
Young Stellar Objects we need to quantify the variability timescales
and amplitudes of both Class I/II (stars with disks, including
Classical T Tauris) and Class III (Weak-line T Tauris).  Inclusion of
eruptive variables (FUor/EXor) is appropriate as well.

In brief, Weak-line T-Tauris are quasi-periodic with amplitudes of 0.1
to 0.3 mag and periods 1 to $\sim$15 days, so their variability is
comparable to that of $\gamma$ Dor stars. Given the temporal evolution
of cool spots, a period recovery analysis such as shown for RR Lyrae
stars is likely difficult.  The embedded systems and Classical T
Tauris are irregular variables but have been shown to have distinctive
colors due to extinction and the ultraviolet and blue excess arising
from accretion shocks.

Table \ref{table:pseudoForExor} shows a possible Figure of Merit for the recovery by LSST of the distribution of EXor high-state duration in outburst.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

Galactic star formation regions are largely found at low Galactic
latitudes or within the Gould Belt structure. As such study of young
stars with LSST is closely tied to other science goals concerning the
Milky Way Disk and is subject to the concerns of both crowded field
photometry and the observing cadence along the Milky Way.

The embedded and Classical T Tauri stars also undergo significant and
rapid color changes due to accretion processes. The ability of LSST to
track these variations in color could be limited by the interval
between filter changes.
