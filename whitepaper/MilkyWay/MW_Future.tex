\section{Ongoing Developments}

% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

\new{This Section contains extremely brief initial notes for important
  science cases that (as of the current writing in mid-April 2016) are
  in an earlier stage of development than the cases in the previous
  sections. However we do not want these investigations to become neglected.}

%A short preamble goes here. What's the context for this science
%project? Where does it fit in the big picture?

%% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:MW_Future_targets}

%Describe the discoveries and measurements you want to make.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Formation history of the Bulge and present-day balance of populations:} Sensitivity to metallicity and age distribution of Bulge objects near the Main Sequence Turn-off;
    \item {\it Migration and heating in the Milky Way disk:} Error and bias in the determination of components in the (velocity dispersion vs metallicity) diagram, for disk populations along various lines of sight (e.g. Loebman et al. 2016 ApJ 818 L6);
    \item Fraction of Local-Volume objects discovered as a function of survey strategy.
\end{itemize}

%Now, describe their response to the observing strategy. Qualitatively,
%how will the science project be affected by the observing schedule and
%conditions? In broad terms, how would we expect the observing strategy
%to be optimized for this science?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

%\subsection{Metrics}
%\label{sec:\secname:MW_Bulge_metrics}

%Quantifying the response via MAF metrics: definition of the metrics,
%and any derived overall figure of merit.


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

%\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
%\label{sec:\secname:MW_Bulge_analysis}

%OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
%the time of writing for this science project?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

%\subsection{Discussion}
%\label{sec:\secname:MW_Bulge_discussion}

%Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
%made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
%the identified risks?
