\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:specials:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

The four main LSST science themes, as defined by the Science Book, drive the design of LSST's main Wide-Fast-Deep survey.  However, it has always been recognized that many important scientific projects, including some that are highly relevant to LSST's main science themes, are not well served by the areal coverage and/or cadence constraints placed on the WFD survey.  The LSST Project thus set aside a nominal 10\% of the observing time to serve what are collectively called ``special surveys''.  In addition, the LSST commissioning period may be available for use by special programs.  Projects that will certainly make use of this 10\% time not dedicated to the WFD survey include the Deep Drilling fields and Galactic Plane surveys described separately in this paper, as well as any survey wishing to observe at declinations below $-60^\circ$, such as the Magellanic Clouds.  These special programs heavily oversubscribe the nominal 10\% of time assigned to them.  It is of thus critical importance for these programs to define compelling science cases, clearly justify their observing requirements, and derive metrics to quantify the performance of a given schedule for the program.  An extra degree of freedom that these special surveys 


As mentioned previously, the Deep Drilling and Milky Way plane surveys are described separately in this paper.  In this section, we describe the goals of two special surveys designed to serve scientific goals related to the Magellanic Clouds.  Descriptions of other special surveys, including candidate commissioning programs, are welcome here.
