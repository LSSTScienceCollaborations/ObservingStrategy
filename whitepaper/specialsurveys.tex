\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:specials:intro}

The four main LSST science themes, as defined by the Science Book,
drive the design of LSST's main Wide-Fast-Deep survey.  However, it
has always been recognized that many important scientific projects,
including some that are highly relevant to LSST's main science themes,
are not well served by the areal coverage and/or cadence constraints
placed on the WFD survey.  To this end, the LSST Project set aside a
nominal 10\% of the observing time to serve what are collectively
called ``special surveys''.

Projects that
will certainly make use of this 10\% time (that is not dedicated to the WFD
survey) include the Deep Drilling fields and the Galactic Plane surveys,
as well as any survey wishing to
observe at declinations below $-60^\circ$, such as the Magellanic
Clouds.  These special programs have the potential to
heavily oversubscribe the nominal 10\%
of time assigned to them.  It is of thus critical importance for these
programs to define compelling science cases, clearly justify their
observing requirements, and derive metrics to quantify the performance
of a given schedule for the program. This chapter provides a venue for
such investigations.

% A minimal set of 4--5 ``extragalactic'' Deep Drilling Fields have been
% included in the `OpSim' runs to date (\autoref{chp:cadexp}), and have
% been evaluated in various science sections throughout this paper.
% Here, we aim to explore some other proposals for Deep Drilling Fields, and
% make some suggestions for \OpSim runs based on them. As well as these
% DDF's, we also describe
% a special survey designed to serve scientific
% goals related to the Magellanic Clouds, and
% several special surveys
% aimed at particular Solar System science cases.  Descriptions of
% further proposed special surveys are welcome here.
