\section{AGN Size and Structure with Microlensing}
\def\secname{\chpname:microlensing}\label{sec:\secname}

Microlensing due to stars projected on top of individual
gravitationally-lensed quasar images produces additional magnification.
Using the fact that the Einstein radii of stars in lensing galaxies
closely match the scales of different emission regions in
high-redshift AGNs (micro-arcseconds), analyzing microlensing induced
flux variations statistically on individual systems allows us to
measure ``sizes'' of AGN regions.

Assuming a thermal profile for accretion disks, sizes in different emission
wavelengths will be probed and as such, placing constraints on the slope of this
thermal profile. Given the sheer number of lensed systems that LSST is expected
to discover ($\sim8000$), this will allow us to stack systems for better
constraints and hopefully determine the {\it luminosity and redshift evolution
of the disk size and profile.} Due to the typical relative velocities of lenses,
microlenses, observers (Earth) and source AGN, the microlensing variation
timescales are between months to a few decades.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

Analysis of microlensing induced variability will allow the measurement of
accretion disk sizes $R_\lambda$ and their thermal profile slope $\alpha$. This
needs to be done per system discovered. Assuming $\sim$1000 lensed quasars with
high quality light curves (i.e. that allow time delay measurements, see
\autoref{sec:lenstimedelays}), a relationship between size, thermal profile
slope, black hole mass and accretion disk luminosity will likely be derived.

How precisely are we going to be able to measure these parameters for a given
survey strategy? This is not a simple question to answer due to the significant
degeneracies that plague the phenomenon. This is what our MAF metric will
quantify. Before we design this, we need to predict and statistically quantify
the degeneracies and sensitivities.

% \new{Our goal is to understand the population of AGN accretion disk sizes
% and profiles. We anticipate doing this via a hierarchical model where
% these properties are related to each other in some way, perhaps via
% power law scaling relations. A very simple version of this is the following...
% \newline\newline
% So, our targets are the parameters $a$ and $b$, that describe this
% simple population. How well will we be able to measure these, for a
% given survey strategy? This is what our MAF metric will quantify.
% Before we design this, we can predict the likely sensitivities of this
% measurement.}

The quasar microlensing optical depth is $\sim1$, so every lensed quasar should
be affected by microlensing at any given point in time to a different extent.
Note, however, that the larger the apparent magnification, the more stringent are
the constraints on the geometric information that can be obtained of the source.
\citet{MosqueraandKochanek2011} studied the expected microlensing
timescales for all known lensed quasars at the time. They found that the median
Einstein crossing time scales, which can statistically be interpreted as the
time between high magnification events, in the observed $I$-band, is of the order
of $\sim20$~yr (with a distribution between 10 and 40~yr). Additionally, the source
crossing time (duration of a high magnification event) is $\sim7.3$~months (with
a distribution tail up to 3~yr). This basically means that out of all the lensed
quasar {\em images} (microlensing between images is completely uncorrelated)
about half of them will be quiescent during the 10~yr baseline of LSST. However,
since the typical number of lensed images is either two or four, this means
that, statistically, in every system, one (for doubles) or two (for quads) high
magnification events should be observed in 10~yr of LSST monitoring.

Note that, the important cadence parameter is the source crossing time. Ideally,
high magnification events would need to be as uniformly sampled as possible. The
$\sim 7.3$ months crossing time is the median for the observed $i$-band, but this time
would be significantly shorter for bluer bands: for a thermal profile with slope
$\alpha: R_\lambda \propto \lambda^\alpha$ implies source crossing time $t_{\rm
s} \propto \lambda^{1/\alpha} \rightarrow t_u=t_i \times (\lambda_{\rm u} /
\lambda_{\rm i})^{1/\alpha}$. For a Shakura-Sunyaev slope of $\alpha=0.75$ this
would correspond to $\sim 7.3 \times (3600/8140)^{4/3}$ months which is $\approx 2.5$
months in the $u$-band.

In terms of the cadence, at least three evenly sampled data points per band
within two to three months would be preferred to be able to map the constraining
high magnification event, and these would hopefully be uniformly spaced.
Additionally, LSST can trigger imaging of high-magnification events with dedicated
facilities to enhance these constraints. More frequent sampling (e.g., in the DDFs)
would increase such constraints significantly. However, since lensed quasars are not
that common, this smaller area would mean that only a modest number ($<100$)
of suitable systems will be monitored in the DDFs.

Regarding the season length, the ``months'' timescale of high
magnification events very likely means that we can/will miss high
magnification events in the season gaps, at least in the bluer bands.

``Show stopper'': observations spread on timescales larger than 3 months.
This would likely miss the high magnification events. In those cases
we could perhaps consider close consecutive photometric bands as
equivalent accretion disk regions, however this would mean weaker
constraints on the thermal profile.

{\bf Caveats:} The above estimates correspond to those obtained by
\citet{MosqueraandKochanek2011} for all \emph{currently} known lensed quasars.
It is important to take into consideration that the timescales directly depend
on the projected velocities of the three-plane system: the redshifts of the lens
and source as well as their respective peculiar velocites along the CMB dipole
velocity in the direction towards the lensing galaxies (observer's peculiar
velocity). Therefore, every new system will have a different timescale.
Furthermore, the discussion above is centered on high magnification events. Even
though these produce the most valuable information, low magnification events or
\emph{no} magnification events can set constraints on the structure of high
redshift AGN as well as the lensing galaxies (e.g. \citealt{gilmerino2005}).
Finally, long timescale high accuracy multiband data as will be delivered by
LSST have never been obtained to date for any lensed system. Coupling this fact
to a factor $\sim$10 increase on the number of lensed quasars known, LSST will
enable of totally new and unprecedented perspectives for microlensing studies.
%
% Important Note: all this science needs to be done on lensed quasars
% with measured or very short time delays to remove the intrinsic
% variability signal, which might significantly reduce the sample.

{\bf Microlensing Aided Reverberation Mapping:} Given that microlensing mostly
affects continuum emission rather than  broad line emission, microlensing can enable
the disentangling of the broad line emission plus the continuum emission in single
photometric bands, allowing the use of single broad band PRM measurements
\citep{SluseandTewes2014}. As with the two-band PRM method discussed above, the
denser (and the longer) the sampling, the more accurate are the constraints that
can be obtained for the time delays. This method allows constraining both the
accretion disk structure as explained above and the Broad Emission Line Region (BELR). The only additional
requirement is one spectroscopic observation to constrain the ``macro''
magnification ratios from narrow emission lines.

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

Metrics for these section need to be defined by using simulated light curves
that take into account the several parameters that come into play in quasar
microlensing. These include: the time gap between visits in the same band,
projected CMB velocity, simulated peculiar velocities and redshifts of lenses
and sources as well as ``macro'' lens model parameters (i.e., surface mass
density and shear projected on top of lensed quasar images). Two metrics are
currently in consideration:

High Magnification Events recovery metric: This metric will measure the
number of high magnification events recovered/missed considering the
cadence and season length in every LSST band and as the precision of the
brightness measurement.

Accretion disk size and slope metric: This metric will do a full
analysis of the ``pure'' microlensing light curves to recover these two
physical AGN parameters. The figure of merit would be the accuracy of
the measurement.

Since microlensing signal can only be obtained after time delays between images
have been measured, both metrics need close interaction with time delay
measurements. As such, the ``Time Delays Challenges'' (see
\autoref{sec:lenstimedelays}) will include complete microlensing signal
simulations which also take into account the aforementioned parameters. Note
that given
the dependence on individual filter cadence and season length as well as
projected CMB velocities, every region on the sky needs to be considered
independently. Time Delay Challenge submissions will thus include recovered
``pure'' microlensing
light curves in addition to measured time-delays. By doing the reverse
procedure, i.e. using these ``pure'' microlensing light curves to statistically
re obtain the input accretion disk sizes and thermal slopes, we will be able to
quantitatively measure the accuracy of the intrinsic accretion disk parameter
estimations for a given survey strategy.

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

Much like the cosmology with lensed quasar time delays, we expect a strong
dependence of both proposed metrics with night-to-night cadence, uniformity and
season length. Maximizing these will maximize the likelihood of recovering high
magnification events, which in turn will provide the most stringent constraints
on
accretion disk structure. As mentioned above, since shorter wavelengths show
faster and stronger magnification events, in an ideal scenario, bluer bands would have
tighter night-to-night cadence.

\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/agn/NightSep_seasonLength.pdf}
		\caption{Median Night Separation in days (left) and median season length in months (right) for all bands in the current ``Baseline Cadence'' (\opsimdbref{db:baseCadence}, top) and ``No Visit Pairs''	(\opsimdbref{db:NoVisitPairs}, bottom) opsim outputs.}
		\label{microfig}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}

As shown in figure \ref{microfig}, it seems there is a slightly better prospect
for the AGN structure with microlensing science case using the ``No Visit Pairs'' observing
strategy in comparison to the baseline strategy due to the smaller inter-night
gaps and longer season lengths in the g band. In both cases the night-to-night
cadence in the longer wavebands are compatible with the detection of most
microlensing events. On the other hand, in the u and g bands in both survey strategies it might compromise the results. Furthermore, in all LSST bands the spread in the night-to-night cadence (uniformity) and season length will likely dominate the uncertainties.
