% This individual section will need to describe the particular
% discoveries and measurements that are being targeted in this section's
% science case. It will be helpful to think of a ``science case" as a
% ``science project" that the authors {\it actually plan to do}. Then,
% the sections can follow the tried and tested format of an observing
% proposal: a brief description of the investigation, with references,
% followed by a technical feasibility piece. This latter part will need
% to be quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that
% need to be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its
% impact on the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be
% combined in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude
% with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how
% these could be mitigated.

% A short preamble goes here. What's the context for this science
% project? Where does it fit in the big picture?

A variety of AGN variability studies will be enabled by LSST. These are
intended to probe the physical properties of the unresolved inner regions
of the central engine. Relations will be sought between variability amplitude
and timescale vs. $L$, $z$, $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, color, multiwavelength and
spectroscopic properties, if available. For example, LSST AGNs exhibiting excess
variability over that expected from their luminosities will be further scrutinized
as candidates for lensed systems having unresolved images with the excess
(extrinsic) variability being attributed mainly to microlensing.

Measuring time-delayed responses between variations in the continuum flux
in one LSST band to the continuum flux in another, will be one of the
main themes of AGN science in the LSST era (e.g., \citet{Chelouche2013};
\citet{CheloucheandZucker2013}; \citet{EdelsonEtal2015}; \citet{FausnaughEtal2015}).
Such measurements can test accretion disk models in a robust manner
for a considerably larger number of AGNs than is currently feasible
with microlensing (see section~\ref{sec:microlensing}).

Theories of the hierarchical merger of dark matter halos over cosmic 
time predict that galaxy-galaxy mergers should result in the formation
of a large number of binary SMBHs. This population is predicted to be a strong,
stochastic contributor to the overall gravitational wave background
\citep{2015arXiv151105564T}. The inspiral of gravitationally bound pairs of
SMBHs formed by a major merger may `stall', reducing the gravitational wave
signal \citep{2014SSRv..183..189C}. Potentially periodic AGN variability,
leading to tentative discoveries of binary SMBHs (e.g.,
\citet{2015Natur.525..351D}; \citet{GrahamEtal2015}; \citet{LiuEtal2015}),
may be feasible for LSST for periods ranging from a few
days up to $\sim3$~yr over the entire survey. The fraction of close SMBHs,
tentatively detected by LSST, may provide strong constraints on the strength
of the graviational wave signal expected from the inspiral.

In the deep-drilling fields (DDFs), the LSST sampling is expected to provide
high-quality power spectral density (PSD) functions for $\approx10^{5} - 10^{6}$
AGNs cross $L$, $z$, and $\lambda_{\rm eff}$ down to frequencies of $\sim1$~d$^{-1}$.
These PSDs can enhance AGN selection, and can be used to constrain the SMBH
mass and accretion rate/mode, as well as enable searching for periodic or
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
%
%Potentially periodic AGN variability, leading to tentative discoveries
%of binary SMBHs (e.g., \citet{GrahamEtal2015}), may also be
%measurable.
%

%Photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), measuring the time-delayed
%response of either the flux of the broad emission line region (BELR)
%lines to the flux of the AGN continuum or between the continuum flux
%in one (longer wavelength) band to the continuum flux in another (band
%with shorter wavelength), will be one of the cornerstones of AGN
%research in the LSST era (e.g., \citet{Chelouche2013};
%\citet{CheloucheandZucker2013}; \citet{CheloucheEtal2014};
%\citet{EdelsonEtal2015}; \citet{FausnaughEtal2015}). For example, LSST
%is expected to deliver BELR line-continuum time delays in
%$\sim10^5-10^6$ sources, which is unprecedented when compared to
%$\sim50-100$ such measurements conducted via the traditional, yet much
%more expensive (per source) spectroscopic method. Sources in the
%deep-drilling fields (DDFs) will benefit from the highest quality PRM
%time-delay measurements given the factor of $\sim10$ denser sampling.


The high-frequency QPO (HFQPO) periods expected from the inner accretion disk
(which provide stable clocks located closer to the horizon as the BH spin increases)
can be estimated from those of the fundamental $g$-mode, which agree with
the observed HFQPO frequencies in stellar-mass BH binaries. Utilizing the
theoretical upper bounds for BH spin and $L/L_{\rm Edd}$, and the lower
bound to the $k$- and bolometric correction $B_n(z)$, one obtains
$\log P({\rm hr}) > 0.4(1-m_n) + \log[(1+z)D_{\rm L}(z)^2]$ for magnitude
$m_n$ in a particular band $n$ and luminosity distance $D_{\rm L}(z)$.
The $k$- and bolometric correction $B_n(z)$ is a decreasing function of BH mass,
but an increasing function of BH spin. The Lyman-alpha forest limits the redshift
range to $z < 2.7$ for $g$-band observations. The HFQPOs will be weaker within longer
wavelength bands.
%The $\sim 80$ visits in the $g$-band proposed for the main survey appears 
%insufficient to produce a useful PSD. The expected HFQPO periods are longer than a few hour visit in a DDF.
For instance, for $m_g  <  23$ and the optimal $z =  2.7$, the HFQPO period is $P > 4$~hr.
%
%QPO search will be most relevant for the DDFs,
Searching for HFQPOs in the DDFs will be most effective if the sampling frequency
in those fields for the $u$ and $g$ bands is at least nightly, i.e., $\gtsim3000$
visits during the entire survey. Using HFQPOs at such frequencies, LSST will be
sensistive to probing SMBHs down to $\approx10^{5} - 10^{6}~M_{\sun}$. 

%In addition, there's a need for an "ultradeep" field, e.g., the MCs, that will
%be monitored, during commissioning phase, with frequencies in the range ~$1$-$10^4$ min. (i.e., from
%minutes to weeks/months).

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

%We will measure the power spectral density (PSD) of AGN light 
%curves across $L$, $z$, and $\lambda_{\rm eff}$. Specifically, we will
%measure the short timescale ($\leq 5$~d) spectral index of the PSD and
%the locations of `features' such as QPOs
%and breaks in the PSD.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{figs/agn/AGN_Variability_01.pdf}
\caption{Behavior of the spectral index of the PSD (black) of the Kepler Sy1 
AGN Zw 229-15. This AGN is well-modelled by a C-ARMA(2,1) process. The spectral index varies
from 0 to 4 depending upon the frequency. Insufficient sampling of the light
curve (e.g. a few times a month), can result in the erroneous conclusion that a 
damped random walk (DRW) model (max spectral slope 2), adequately 
characterizes the variability.
}
\label{PSDvsFreq}
\end{figure}

Determination of the hyperparmeters that describe the PSD requires high frequency
sampling of the light curve ($\sim 1$~d$^{-1}$). Figure \ref{PSDvsFreq} shows
the frequency dependence of the spectral index of the PSD (black) of the Kepler Sy 1 AGN 
Zw 229-15. The light curve of this AGN is well-modelled by a C-ARMA(2,1) 
model. The C-ARMA(2,1) is a higher order random walk than the 
Damped Random Walk (DRW) of \citet{Kelly09} which is a C-ARMA(1,0)
 model. Recent varaibility studies indicate that the simple C-ARMA(1,0) 
model is insufficient to model AGN variability because the spectral
 index of the C-ARMA(1,0)
model is mathematically constrained to be 2 \citep{Kelly14,Kasliwal15,Simm15}. 
The PSD (black line) is the ratio of an even polynomial numerator (orange line) to 
an even polynomial denominator (brown line). Different powers of frequency dominate
the PSD at different frequencies depending on the hyperparameters of the C-ARMA(2,1) model. It is
clear that in the case of this AGN, the light curve must be sampled on timescales {\em shorter} than 
$1$-$5$ days in order to observe the $\nu^{-4}$ behavior characteristic of a higher order random walk.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{figs/agn/AGN_Variability_00.png}
\caption{The effect of sampling cadence on hyperparameter estimation.}
\label{CadenceEffec}
\end{figure}

Accurate recovery of the PSD hyperparameters is greatly enhanced by rapid sampling. Figure \ref{CadenceEffect}
shows the effect of the sampling frequency on the inferred joint distribution of two
 hyperparameters of the C-ARMA(2,1) model, the 
oscillator timescale and the damping ratio. Degrading the sampling frequency from $1/$($30$~min) 
(Kepler) to $1/$($3$~d) changes both the size and the shape of the joint distribution i.e. it degrades both 
the accuracy and correlation of the inferred hyperparameters. 

%The PRM measurements will probe the size and structure of the
%accretion disk and BELR, in a statistical sense, and may provide
%improved SMBH mass estimates for sources that have at least
%single-epoch spectra. \new{Our goal is to understand the population of
%AGN broad line regions, including their geometry. We expect to do this
%via  a model that connects the BH mass, BLR geometry and AGN
%photometric variability properties via a set of scaling relations. A
%simple version of this is could be something like...\newline\newline
%So, our target measurements are of $a$ and $b$, the X parameters.
%Before we derive a metric that quantifies our ability to measure these
%parameters, we can anticipate some of the sensitivity of the
%photometric RM method to observing strategy.}

%\new{We focus on the PSD function as a way of characterizing AGN
%variability in various ways. What do we expect the AGN population to
%look like in PSD parameter space? The hyper-parameters that govern the
%relationships between PSD parameters and  AGN and host galaxy
%properties are probably of greatest scintific interest.}

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

Quantifying the response via MAF metrics: definition of the metrics,
and any derived overall figure of merit.

\new{In lieu of a simulated AGN population, we focus on a few
particular {\it diagnostic} metrics that capture  our likely ability
to measure the PSD across the population. These include: the
uniformity of the sampling pattern in log time lag?}


%Assess the number of meaningful BELR-continuum time delays that can be obtained
%with the nominal OpSim, and point out potential perturbations in the
%cadence to improve the number and quality of such time delays.

% QPOs - Will the cadence and duration give you the proper range on the
% power spectrum to detect QPOs with a given mass, spin, and L/Ledd?
% (Bob Wagoner)

As for HFQPOs: The amplitude of a HFQPO is very uncertain, as is its
(small) duty cycle. Observations, theory and numerical simulations have
only suggested that the fractional modulation should be small (less than
a few percent). Thus it is not obvious how to choose a metric and observing
strategy to maximize it (other than the choice of band that was already
indicated).


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
the time of writing for this science project?


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

Discussion: what risks have been identified? What suggestions could be
made to improve this science project's figure of merit, and mitigate
the identified risks?
