\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:cosmology:intro}

% Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
% and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

Cosmology is one of the key science themes for which LSST was designed. Our goal is to measure cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy, or departures from General Relativity, with sufficient accuracy to distinguish one model from another, and hence drive our theoretical understanding of how the universe works, as a whole. To do this will necessarily involve a variety of different measurements, that can act as cross-checks of each other, and break parameter degeneracies in any single one.

The  Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) has identified five
different cosmological probes enabled by the LSST: weak lensing (WL),
large scale structure (LSS), type Ia supernovae (SN), strong lensing
(SL), and clusters of galaxies (CL). In all cases, the primary concern
is residual systematic error: the shapes and photometric redshifts of
galaxies, and the properties of supernova and lensed quasar light
curves, will all need to be measured with extraordinary accuracy in order for LSST's high statistical power to be properly harnessed. This accuracy will come from the abundance and heterogeneity of the individual measurements made, and the degree to which they can be modeled and understood. This latter point implies a need for uniformity in the survey, which enables powerful simplifying assumptions to be made when calibrating on the largest, cosmologically most important scales. The need for heterogeneity also implies  uniformity, in the sense that the nuisance parameters that describe the systematic effects need to be sampled over as wide a range as possible (examples include the need to sample a wide range of roll angles to minimize shape error, and observing conditions to understand photometric errors due to the changing atmosphere).

In this chapter we look at some of the key measurements planned by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration, and how they depend on the Observing Strategy.
