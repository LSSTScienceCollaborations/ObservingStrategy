\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:cosmology:intro}

Introduce, with a very broad brush, this chapter's science projects,
and why it makes sense for them to be considered together.

% Includes: survey uniformity, long time series, gap minimization, and
% dithering patterns

% Confirmed leads for survey uniformity and dithering: Eric Gawiser,
% Peter Kurczynski

% Confirmed leads for time delay lens cosmography: Phil Marshall

% Confirmed leads for AGN variability, microlensing and reverberation
% mapping: Ohad Shemmer, Timo Anguita

Give an overview of the generic features of the observing strategy
needed by these projects, bringing out common themes or points of
tension. Suppose we were to design an LSST survey to enable these
measurements: qualitatively, what might it look like, in terms of the
choices we are able to make?

Anticipate the results of the chapter: summarize the results of a
number of investigative sections, where there will be one on each
science case.
