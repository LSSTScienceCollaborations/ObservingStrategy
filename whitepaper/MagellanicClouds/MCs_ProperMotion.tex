In the last decade work with $HST$ has been able to measure the bulk
tangential (in the plane of the sky) velocities ($\sim$300 km/s) of
the Magellanic Clouds (Kallivayalil et al.\ 2016a,b,2013) and even the
rotation of the LMC disk \citep{2014ApJ...781..121V}. Gaia
will measure precise proper motions of stars to $\sim$20th magnitude
which will include the Magellanic red giant branch stars. LSST will be
complementary to Gaia and measure proper motions of stars in the
$\sim$20--24 mag range that includes Magellanic main-sequence stars
which are far more numerous than giants, and, therefore, more useful
for mapping extended stellar structures. The LSST 10-year survey
proper motion precision will be $\sim$0.3--0.4 mas/yr at LMC
main-sequence turnoff at r$\approx$22.5--23.  This will allow for
accurate measurement of proper motions of {\em individual stars} at the
$\sim$5$\sigma$ level.

Besides measuring kinematics, the LSST proper motions can be used to
produce clean samples of Magellanic stars.

In addition, LSST proper motions can be used to improve star/galaxy
separation which is quite significant for faint, blue Magellanic
main-sequence stars.

\subsubsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\chpname:metrics}

The natural Figure of Merit for this science case is the precision
with which the proper motion of the Magellanic Clouds can be measured.
This is likely to depend on the following diagnostic metrics:

% metric on surface brightness limit in different parts of the sky
% to MC structure
% could use metric for how much of the Besla stellar debris we can detect
%  even just that region of the sky covered

\begin{itemize}

\item  Single star proper motion precision, possibly quantified as.
the significance level
($\sigma$-level) of the proper motion measurement of one Magellanic MSTO
star (r=23 mag). We would expect this to take values of
$\sim$2.0 mas yr$^{-1}$ / $\sigma_{\rm pm}$.

%  Metric that calculates the proper motion accuracy of LMC MSTO stars at r=23 and calculates the sigma-level of
%the proper motion measurement (2.0 mas/yr / sigma_pm ).

\item Another useful diagnostic metric would be the surface
brightness limit of the Magellanic structures, using MSTO stars.

\item A metric quantifying how much of the expected Magellanic debris/structure
\citet[from][]{2012MNRAS.421.2109B} model) we can detect would allow the
proper motion science case to be extended to peripheral structures.
This would depend
mostly on the area covered, but we could also use the surface
brightness limit (calculated above) directly.

% \subsection{Conclusions}
%
% Here we answer the ten questions posed in
% \autoref{sec:intro:evaluation:caseConclusions}:
%
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[Q1:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between the sky coverage and coadded depth? For example, should
% the sky coverage be maximized (to $\sim$30,000 deg$^2$, as e.g., in
% Pan-STARRS) or the number of detected galaxies (the current baseline but
% with 18,000 deg$^2$)?}
%
% \item[A1:] ...
%
% \item[Q2:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between uniformity of sampling and frequency of  sampling? For
% example, a rolling cadence can provide enhanced sample rates over a part
% of the survey or the entire survey for a designated time at the cost of
% reduced sample rate the rest of the time (while maintaining the nominal
% total visit counts).}
%
% \item[A2:] ...
%
% \item[Q3:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between the single-visit depth and the number of visits
% (especially in the $u$-band where longer exposures would minimize the
% impact of the readout noise)?}
%
% \item[A3:] ...
%
% \item[Q4:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% Galactic plane coverage (spatial coverage, temporal sampling, visits per
% band)?}
%
% \item[A4:] ...
%
% \item[Q5:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% fraction of observing time allocated to each band?}
%
% \item[A5:] ...
%
% \item[Q6:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% cadence for deep drilling fields?}
%
% \item[A6:] ...
%
% \item[Q7:] {\it Assuming two visits per night, would the science case
% benefit if they are obtained in the same band or not?}
%
% \item[A7:] ...
%
% \item[Q8:] {\it Will the case science benefit from a special cadence
% prescription during commissioning or early in the survey, such as:
% acquiring a full 10-year count of visits for a small area (either in all
% the bands or in a  selected set); a greatly enhanced cadence for a small
% area?}
%
% \item[A8:] ...
%
% \item[Q9:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% sampling of observing conditions (e.g., seeing, dark sky, airmass),
% possibly as a function of band, etc.?}
%
% \item[A9:] ...
%
% \item[Q10:] {\it Does the case have science drivers that would require
% real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant
% single-visit limiting depth?}
%
% \item[A10:] ...
