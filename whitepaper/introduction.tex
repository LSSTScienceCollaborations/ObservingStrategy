The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a dedicated optical
telescope with an effective aperture of 6.7 meters, currently under
construction on Cerro Pach\'on in the Chilean Andes.  The telescope
and camera will have a huge field of view, 9.6 deg$^2$, and the
\'etendue, i.e., the product of collecting area and field of view will
be significantly larger than any other optical telescope.  Thus this telescope
is designed for wide-field deep imaging of the sky; its mantra is
``Wide-Deep-Fast'', i.e., the ability to cover large swaths of sky
(``Wide'') to faint magnitudes (``Deep'') in a short amount of time
(``Fast''), allowing it to scan the sky repeatedly.  LSST will image
in six broad filters, $ugrizy$, spanning the optical band from the
atmospheric cutoff in the ultraviolet to the limit of CCD sensitivity
in the near-infrared.  

  The science case for the LSST is based broadly on four science
  themes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dark energy and dark matter (via measurements of strong and weak lensing,
  large-scale structure, clusters of galaxies, and supernovae);
\item Exploring the transient and variable universe;
\item Studying the structure of the Milky Way galaxy and its neighbors
  via resolved stellar populations;
\item An inventory of the Solar System, including Near Earth Asteroids
  and Potential Hazardous Objects, Main Belt Asteroids, and
  Kuiper Belt Objects.
\end{itemize}

These themes, together with {\em many} other science applications, are
described in detail in the
\href{http://lsst.org/scientists/scibook}{LSST Science Book}, produced
by the LSST Project Team and Science collaborations in 2009.  The
present white paper represents an important next step in science
planning beyond the Science Book.  In particular, we now need to
quantify how well the LSST (for a given realization of its observing
strategy, or ``{\em cadence}'') will be able to carry out its science
goals; indeed, we will use this quantification to refine and optimize
the cadence itself.  To zeroth order, the large \'etendue of LSST
allows it to meet all its science goals with a single dataset with a
universal cadence.  This document describes the design of the LSST
cadence and the various ways in which can be further refined to
optimize the science output of the survey.  As we describe in detail
below, we quantify the effectiveness of a given cadence realization to
meet science goals by defining a series of quantitative {\em metrics}.
Any given realization will be more favorable for some science areas,
and less so for others; the metrics allow us to quantify this, and
optimize the overall cadence for the broadest range of LSST science
areas.

In the six years since the Science Book was written, some of the
science themes described in there have evolved or become obselete,
while new science opportunities and ideas have arisen.  Moreover, our
understanding of the capabilities (such as system response and
therefore depth, telescope optics, and so on) have matured
considerably.  The present document endeavors to explore the principal
science themes as described in the Science Book, but is not slaved to
them, and where appropriate, we will point out relevant updates to the
Science Book.

\section{Synoptic Sky Surveying at Universal Cadence}
\def\secname{intro:baseline}\label{sec:\secname}

  The LSST defined a so-called ``baseline cadence'', described in the
  \href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008arXiv0805.2366I}{LSST
    overview paper} and Chapter 3 of the Science Book.  This was used
  to demonstrate that LSST could meet its basic science goals, and
  indeed the formal
  \href{https://www.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/LPM-17}{science
    requirements}.    As 
  described in these references, the default LSST exposure is 15
  seconds, and all exposures are taken in pairs, called a ``{\em
    visit}'', before the telescope is slewed to a neighboring field.
   Any given field is observed twice on a given night, which allows
   preliminary trajectories of asteroids to be determined.  

   The baseline cadence optimizes the amount of sky covered in any
   given night (subject to the constraint of observing at airmass less
   than 1.4 throughout), and allows the entire sky visible at any time
   of the year to be covered in about three nights.  The cadence is
   designed to give uniform coverage at any given time, and reaches
   survey goals for measuring stellar parallax and proper motion over
   the ten-year survey.  The survey requirements on depth lead to
   roughly 825 visits (summing over the six filters) in the 10-year
   LSST survey to any given point on the sky.  The resulting
   Deep-Wide-Fast component of the survey covers roughly 18,000
   deg$^2$ of high Galactic latitude sky, and requires about 85\% of
   the available observing time. 

   There are obvious science cases that the Deep-Wide-Fast survey does
   not address, and thus the remaining 15\% of the telescope time in
   the baseline cadence is devoted to a series of specialized
   surveys.  They are as follows: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Imaging at low Galactic latitudes.  This is currently defined as
  a wedge which is broader closer to the Galactic Center,
  corresponding roughly to a locus of constant stellar density.  In
  this region, the number of repeat observations is reduced, given the
  confusion limit in the stacked LSST data. 
\item Imaging in the South Celestial Cap.  The airmass limit of 1.4
  restricts observations to declination $> -70^\circ$ ({\bf get
    precise value}), thus missing both the Magellanic Clouds.
  Observations are done in the Cap to cover this region of sky, again
  to shallower depth. 
\item Imaging in a series of four {\em Deep Drilling Fields}, single
  pointings in which 
  we will obtain roughly four {\bf check!} times more exposures in all
  filters in order to go about a magnitude fainter in the stacked
  data, as well as to get better sampled light curves of variable
  objects. 
\item Imaging in the Northern portions of the Ecliptic Plane.  The
  airmass limit of 1.4 restricts us to declination $< +2^\circ$ ({\bf
    get precise value}), which means that much of the ecliptic plane
  is uncovered.  By observing with a reduced cadence close to the
  Ecliptic Plane north of this limit, we will be able to significantly
  increase the fraction of Near-Earth Asteroids and Main Belt
  Asteroids for which LSST obtains orbits.
\end{itemize}

  The LSST Project has developed an ``Operations Simulator'' (\OpSim),
  described in detail in Chapter~\ref{chp:cadexp} of this paper, which includes a
  realistic model of telescope operations, including time required for
  camera readout, slew time, filter exchange, as well as time loss due
  to clouds.  Given a series of ``proposals'' {\bf Do we still want to
    use this vocabulary?} that set priorities of which fields to
  observe at any given time, \OpSim has developed a series of
  realizations of the series of observations that make up the ten-year
  LSST survey.  Given such a realization, \OpSim outputs detailed
  metrics describing, for example, the expected depth of the LSST
  survey in each filter as a function of time.  The baseline cadence
  is a specific realization of the \OpSim output, which meets the LSST
  survey requirements, following the rules briefly outlined above.  
   
  Again, while the baseline cadence demonstrates that the LSST is
  capable of meeting its stated science goals, it is not optimized for
  all science, and Chapter~\ref{chp:cadexp} of this document describes a series of
  experiments varying the assumptions in \OpSim.  In
  Chapter~\ref{chp:specialsurveys}, we explore additional ideas for
  future experiments to be done in \OpSim.

\section{Beyond the Baseline Observing Strategy}

Optimizing the Observing Strategy: what perturbations are we
permitted to introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?
What are our constraints? And our opportunities?

\section{Evaluation and Optimization of the LSST Observing Strategy}
\def\secname{intro:evaluation}\label{sec:\secname}

The next step is to quantify how well any given realization of the
LSST observing strategy (i.e., an output of \OpSim) supports the (many)
science projects that LSST will enable.  As the algorithms controlling
\OpSim are varied, some projects will benefit, while others may
suffer.  By quantifying this for each projects, we can determine which cadence
maximizes the science potential overall of the project. 

Thus we need 
%e first step towards a science-based optimization of the LSST
%observing strategy is 
a {\it science-based evaluation of the baseline
  LSST observing strategy and its variants}. After simulating a sample
observing schedule consistent with this strategy (see
\autoref{chp:cadexp}), we then need to quantify its value to each
science team.  This is what the LSST DM Sims team's ``Metric Analysis
Framework'' was designed to enable. Once the fiducial strategy has
been evaluated in this way, then any other strategy can be evaluated
in the same terms, using the same code, and we will be able to %start
optimize the strategy through iterations between \OpSim and MAF.

With this program in mind, it makes sense to define {\it one ``Figure
of Merit'' (FoM) per science project}, that captures the value of  the
observing strategy under consideration to that science team. This FoM
will probably be a function of several ``metrics'' that quantify
lower-level features of the observing sequence.  For Figures of Merit
to be directly comparable between disparate science projects,  they
need to be dimensional, and have the same units. One natural
choice could be the {\it information gained} by the science team, in
bits. This is a well-defined statistical quantity, albeit not yet one
in common use. A given observing schedule's value would then depend on
both this information gain, but also {\it how much that information is
worth to the whole community}. It is at this point that the debate
could become heated: probably the best we can do in Cadence Diplomacy
is to quantify all the information gains implied by each proposed
change to the baseline  observing strategy, combine them to see
whether it makes everyone happy, and iterate. In this way we might
hope to minimize the debates about the less quantifiable worth of each
piece of information.

We are some way from being able to define information-based Figures of
Merit for most science cases -- but the metrics that they will depend
on will be easier to derive. Writing this white paper is an
opportunity to think through the Figure of Merit for each science
project that we as a community want to carry out, and how that measure
of success is likely (or even known) to depend on metrics that
summarize the observing sequence presented to us. Thinking about the
problem in terms of science projects, each with a  Figure of Merit,
encourages us to design modular document sections, with one science
project and one Figure of Merit per section.

{\bf I am not sure the following paragraph belongs in the white paper;
  it is more a description of the writing process.}

This will have the happy side-effect of allowing the chapters to be
straightforwardly re-arranged as we go, to make the white paper easier
to read. It will also naturally lead to the definition of a suite of
MAF  super-metrics, can be evaluated on any future \OpSim output
database.  A table in each section showing the values of the metrics
and the FoM, for different schedules, for that science project, will
be very helpful. The metric names in these tables should match the
metric class names in the
\href{https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib/wiki}{\simsMafContrib}
module. In principle these tables could be auto-generated by the MAF
framework, and extended as \OpSim is repeatedly reconfigured and run.

For an example of how all this could look, please see the
\hyperref[sec:lenstimedelays]{lens
time delays section}. The MAF subsections are still under development
there, but keep checking back to see it come together during the
August 2015 workshop week. Templates for the chapters and sections can
be found in \autoref{chp:example}.

\section{Outline of This Paper}
\def\secname{intro:outline}\label{sec:\secname}

The rest of this white paper is structured as follows. In
\autoref{chp:cadexp} we describe a number of \OpSim simulated observing
schedules (``cadences'') explored by the LSST Sims team in summer 2015
in preparation for this paper: they include a ``baseline cadence'', and
then some small but interesting perturbations to it. Then, we present
the science cases considered so far, organised into the following
chapters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \autoref{chp:solarsystem}: \nameref{chp:solarsystem}
    \item \autoref{chp:galaxy}: \nameref{chp:galaxy}
    % \item \autoref{chp:astrometry}: \nameref{chp:astrometry}
    \item \autoref{chp:variables}: \nameref{chp:variables}
    \item \autoref{chp:transients}: \nameref{chp:transients}
    \item \autoref{chp:MCs}: \nameref{chp:MCs}
    \item \autoref{chp:agn}: \nameref{chp:agn}
    \item \autoref{chp:cosmo}: \nameref{chp:cosmo}
    % \item \autoref{chp:deepdrilling}: \nameref{chp:deepdrilling}
    \item \autoref{chp:specialsurveys}: \nameref{chp:specialsurveys}
    \item \autoref{chp:wfirst}: \nameref{chp:wfirst}
\end{itemize}

Finally, in \autoref{chp:tradeoffs} we bring the results of all the
science metric analyses  together and discuss the tensions between
them, and the trade-offs that we can anticipate having to make.
