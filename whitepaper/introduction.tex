Preamble.

\section{The Baseline Observing Strategy}

Synoptic Surveying with LSST - the basic observing strategy determined
by key projects described in the LSST Science Requirements Document,
and constrained by the LSST's design \citep{IvezicEtal2008}.

Optimizing the Observing Strategy - what perturbations can we
introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?
