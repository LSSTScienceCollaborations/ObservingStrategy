\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{~~~~~~~~~Summary}

Galactic science cases fall roughly into two observational categories
based on stellar density and/or Galactic latitude. (i) Strategy
assessment for the {\it high-density or low-latitude} cases is dominated
by large variation in total time allocation for the inner Plane (where
most of the Galaxy's stars are found), since the current strategy
options tend to complete their inner-Plane observations within the first
$\sim 7$~months of the survey (see Chapter \ref{chp:cadexp}). Any
science case requiring more than a years' coverage in these regions will
not be well-served by most of the currently-run strategy simulations.
Quantitatively, figures of merit for these science cases therefore
suggest the baseline cadence to be factors $\sim 6-60$~worse than the
two comparison strategies chosen that allocate more time to the inner
Plane (Tables \ref{tab_SummaryMWDisk} \& \ref{tab_SummaryMWAstrometry}).
While figures of merit for a number of science cases in this category
have been specified and are in the implementation phase (Section
\ref{sec:MW_Disk:MW_Disk_metrics}), at present it is at least as
important that a wider range of strategies be specified and run {\it
with inner-Plane coverage spread over the full ten-year survey time
baseline.} We encourage the reader to supply suggestions for simulations
meeting this need. (ii). For the {\it any-latitude} category (including
the Solar Neighborhood), basic figures of merit including astrometric
characterization have been run for three choices of strategy (Section
\ref{sec:MW_Astrometry:MW_Astrometry_metrics}). While some degree of
calibration is ongoing, at present roughly $12\%$~of fields show
problematic degeneracy against differential chromatic refraction for all
three strategies. Effort is now needed to implement the science figures
of merit in Section \ref{sec:MW_Astrometry:MW_Astrometry_metrics} that
are based on these astrometry indications. Assessment of the science
strategy impact on the Halo (Section \ref{sec:MW_Halo}) largely rests on
the implementation of a robust star/galaxy separation metric into MAF.
This development is ongoing, led by one of the authors of this Chapter
(CTS).



\section{Introduction}

\def\secname{MW_Intro}\label{sec:\secname}

LSST should produce significant contributions to most areas
of Galactic astronomy. LSST Milky Way science cases cover lengthscales
ranging from a few pc (such as sensitive surveys of low-mass objects in
the Solar Neighborhood), up to many tens of kpc (such as surveys for
low-mass satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and their post-disruption
remnant streams, and beyond this, investigations of resolved stellar
populations in the Local Volume). In this chapter, we investigate a limited set of representative Galactic science cases, with the aims of demonstrating the scientific trade-offs of different observing strategies and of motivating readers to contribute to consderations of LSST's observing strategy.  The LSST Science Book
(particularly chapters 6 and 7) and \citet[][in particular Sections
2.1.4 and 4.4]{IvezicEtal2008} present a broader treatment of both science questions and science cases relevant to Galactic science.\footnote{We do however provide
motivating details for certain science cases in this Chapter,
particularly in \autoref{sec:MW_Disk}, as those cases are not
emphasized in the LSST Science Book or the relevant sections of
\citet{IvezicEtal2008}.}.

Concern about observations towards the inner Galactic Plane has for
several years been a common theme in feedback on LSST's observing
strategy, as the Baseline survey currently expends relatively little
observing time per field at low Galactic latitudes (~30 visits per filter, closely spaced in time).  With few visits per filter and a condensed time sampling, populations found in scientifically interesting numbers only at low
Galactic latitudes might be detected with low efficiency
by LSST under this Baseline strategy. (An example is the probing of the
mass function of moderate-separation extrasolar planets via intra-disk
planetary microlensing, as argued forcefully in \citealt{gould13}).

%At the time of
%writing, observations towards the inner Plane still seem to be
%compromised further by the way OpSim arranges shorter programs to
%completion at early times in the simulated survey. This reduces the time
%baseline available for inner-Plane measurements by a significant factor
%compared to observations away from the Plane.

We explore the scientific
impact of shallow Plane observations by comparing Metrics and Figures of
Merit evaluated for the Baseline cadence (\opsimdbref{db:baseCadence}),
for the PanSTARRS-like strategy (\opsimdbref{db:opstwoPS}) which has
essentially uniform depth at all Galactic latitudes observed, and for
the \opsimdbref{db:NormalGalacticPlane} strategy in which the plane is part of
the Wide-Fast-Deep survey. The evaluation of
Figures of Merit generated by these three observing strategies will
quantify how a range of Milky Way science cases could be
substantially improved by selecting a strategy with increase Plane
coverage, without significant cost to the rest of LSST's scientific
investigations.


\subsection{Chapter terminology and structure}

To tame the diversity of science cases, we have picked
representative cases and grouped them within broad scientific areas,
devoting one Section of this chapter to each grouping of cases. A small
number of Figures of Merit (FoMs) have been described for each case.
At present, science cases are grouped in the following way:
\autoref{sec:MW_Disk} assesses the impact of observing strategy on
LSST's ability to map some representative astrophysically important
populations that are found mostly or exclusively in the Plane.
% \autoref{sec:MW_SFH} discusses the use of LSST to probe star formation
% histories through mostly young populations (see also Section 5.6.).
% \autoref{sec:MW_Dust} discusses the impact of observing strategy on
% ISM constraints.
Several observational challenges for LSST find their
sharpest expression in Milky Way science, including (but not limited to)
measurements of stellar parallax, absolute astrometry, and proper
motions (including the tie-in to the reference frame which will be
provided by the \textit{gaia} mission). For this reason, specific issues
relating to precision astrometry are developed in
\autoref{sec:MW_Astrometry}.
\autoref{sec:MW_Halo} assesses the degree to which structures in the Milky Way's halo can be discriminated and mapped, using tracer populations distinguished by variability and/or derived stellar parameters.
Finally, \autoref{sec:MW_future}
presents descriptions of investigations that are needed to properly
determine LSST's utility for Milky Way science, but which
% at this date (late-April 2016)
are as yet relatively incompletely developed.

Summary Tables are provided that present the figure of merit for each
science case within a given section (one row per figure of merit)
evaluated for each tested observing strategy (one column per
strategy). This summary information appears in
\autoref{tab_SummaryMWDisk} (the Disk),
% \autoref{tab_SummaryMWDust} (the ISM),
% \autoref{tab_SummaryMWHalo} (the Halo), and
\autoref{tab_SummaryMWAstrometry} (Astrometry).


% Examples
% identified at this stage include the uses of LSST to set constraints on
% Galactic components (including the structure of the Bulge, and the
% impact of radial migration in the Disk) and the study of resolved
% stellar populations in the Local Group.

%\subsection{Summary tables for Figures of Merit}
%
%The tables below organize the comparison of Figures of Merit for all
%the science cases considered in this chapter:
%begin{itemize}
 % \item Mapping the Milky Way Halo: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWHalo}
%  \item Mapping the Milky Way Disk: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWDisk}
%    \item The ISM: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWDust}
%  \item Astrometry with LSST: Table \ref{tab_SummaryMWAstrometry}
%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Needed input}
%
%While many of the diagnostic Metrics are relatively well-developed,
%implementation is needed of Figures of Merit (FoMs) that depend on
%these metrics. In some Sections we have sketched out such figures of
%merit, in others the development of a practical FoM is still a topic
%of active development.
