\section{Introduction}
\def\secname{MW_Intro}\label{sec:\secname}

LSST's large survey grasp will yield significant contributions to
essentially all areas of Galactic astronomy. Science cases for Milky
Way astronomy with LSST cover lengthscales from a few pc (such as
sensitive surveys of low-mass objects in the Solar Neighborhood), up
to many tens of kpc (such as sensitive surveys for low-mass satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way and their post-disruption remnant streams,
and beyond this, investiations of resolved stellar populations in the
Local Volume). 

Because the diversity of science cases in the Milky Way is so vast, we
make no attempt to be comprehensive. Much more detail about most of
the LSST science cases, and specific science questions to be answered,
can be found in the LSST Science Book (particularly chapters 6 and 7)
and Ivezic et al. (2008 arXiv 0805.2366, in particular Sections 2.1.4
and 4.4 of that document). In this chapter we present a few
representative science cases that illustrate trade-offs between
observing strategies, for programs at low galactic latitudes as well
as away from the disk, and for programs requiring sufficient cadence
for variability as well as deep integrated imaging. 

As with the rest of this whitepaper, our intention is to provoke the
astronomical community to contribute to the optimization of LSST's
observing strategy. Readers who find that an important area of Milky
Way astronomy is under-served by the treatment here, are welcome to
contact the editors to get involved and contribute improvements. For
example, while inclusion of the inner Galactic plane in the
Wide-Fast-Deep survey would allow characterization of important
populations through variability (as will be shown quantitatively in
Section 4.3), such a dataset would also be of immense value in
disentangling and measuring structural parameters of major galactic
components (for example the tilt angle of the disk and the effects of
radial migration within it). We welcome further development of
quantitative figures of merit by which the appropriateness of LSST's observing
strategies can be assessed in terms of the science of interest to the
reader.

\subsection{Chapter terminology and structure}

In what follows, ``Metrics'' refer to diagnostic metrics of LSST's
technical performance, and are generally rather low-level (for
example, the formal proper motion precision, mapped with location
across the sky). Then, a ``figure of merit'' is a higher-level
quantity that illustrates LSST's utility for the science case of
interest (for example, the uncertainty and/or bias on an astrophysical
parameter of interest, such as the mass function of a certain stellar
population near the Sun).

To try to tame the diversity of science cases, we have picked
representative cases and grouped them within broad scientific areas,
devoting one Section of this chapter to each grouping of cases. Our
intention at this date is to provide a summary Table at the end of
each Section that will present the figure of merit for each science
case within that section (as columns) for each tested observing
strategy (as rows).

At present, science cases are grouped in the following way: Section
\ref{sec:MW_Halo} assesses the degree to which structures in the Milky
Way's halo can be discriminated and mapped, using tracer populations
distinguished by variability and derived stellar parameters. Section
\ref{sec:MW_Disk} assesses the impact of observing strategy on LSST's
ability to map some representative astrophysically important
populations that are found mostly or exclusively in the Plane
(including Dust in the ISM). Several observational challenges for LSST
find their sharpest expression in Milky Way science, including (but
not limited to) measurements of stellar parallax, absolute astrometry,
and proper motions (including the tie-in to the reference frame which
will be provided by the {\it Gaia} mission). For this reason, specific
issues relating to precision astrometry are developed in Section
\ref{sec:MW_Astrometry}.

%\new{(If there is time before posting:)} 
Section \ref{sec:MW_Bulge} will describe two example uses of LSST to
set constraints on Galactic components (the structure of the Bulge,
and constraints on radial migration in the mid-plane), while Section
\ref{sec:MW_LocalVolume} explores the use of LSST to probe the Local
Volume.

\subsection{Needed input}

Many of the diagnostic Metrics are (as of January 2016) relatively
well-developed. What is needed at this stage is the implementation of
the figures of merit that depend on these Metrics. In some Sections we
have sketched out such figures of merit, in others the development of
a useful (and practical) figure of merit is still a topic of active
development. 

We welcome assistance from the reader in the development of the
figures of merit for all sections.
