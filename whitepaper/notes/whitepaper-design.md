# The LSST Observing Strategy

A community whitepaper outlining various science cases and the impacts that observing strategy will have on them, quantified using the Metric Analysis Framework. The paper will describe various strategies and tradeoffs that impact the observing cadence (visit sequence), current cadence baseline, future directions, etc, and should be good enough to present on arXiv. The timescale for producing this white paper, started before and finished after the workshop is many months, hopefully before the next workshop. 

The main points to convey in this white paper are that:

* We have a pretty good idea of how we would deploy LSST: there is a baseline strategy and example cadences, with which it can be demonstrated that the data required for the promised science can be delivered.
* The baseline strategy can and will be optimized - even small improvements can be significant. Most importantly, the strategy is not set in stone and it will evolve.
* The cadence optimization process will be as open and inclusive as technically possible. All stake holders will participate in this process.

Working paper titles:

* "Science Driven Optimization of LSST's Observing Strategy"

**1. Introduction**

  * Synoptic Surveying with LSST - the basic observing strategy determined by key projects described in the LSST Science Requirements Document, and constrained by the LSST's design.
  * Optimizing the Observing Strategy - what perturbations can we introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?
