# The LSST Observing Strategy

A community whitepaper outlining various science cases and the impacts that observing strategy will have on them, quantified using the Metric Analysis Framework.

**1. Introduction**
  * Synoptic Surveying with LSST - the basic observing strategy determined by the LSST's design.
  * Optimizing the Observing Strategy - what perturbations can we introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?

**3. Galactic Transients, Variables and Other Stars**

**4. Mapping Our Galaxy: Positions and Proper Motions**

**5. Rolling Cadence: Extragalactic Time Domain Astronomy**

**6. Keeping It Even: Accurate Cosmological Measurements on the Largest Scales"**

**7. Tensions and Trade-offs
