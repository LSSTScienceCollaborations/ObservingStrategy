# The LSST Observing Strategy

A community whitepaper outlining various science cases and the impacts that observing strategy will have on them, quantified using the Metric Analysis Framework. The paper will describe various cadence strategies, tradeoffs, current baseline, future directions, etc, and should be good enough to present on arXiv. The timescale for producing this white paper, started before and finished after the workshop is many months, hopefully before the next workshop. 

The main points to convey in this white paper are that:

* We have a pretty good idea of how we would deploy LSST: there is a baseline cadence, with which it can be demonstrated that the data required for the promised science can be delivered.
* The baseline cadence can and will be optimized - even small improvements can be significant. Most importantly, the cadence is not set in stone and it will evolve.
* The cadence optimization process will be as open and inclusive as technically possible. All stake holders will participate in this process.

Working paper titles:

* "Science Driven Optimization of LSST's Observing Strategy"

**1. Introduction**
  * Synoptic Surveying with LSST - the basic observing strategy determined by the LSST's design.
  * Optimizing the Observing Strategy - what perturbations can we introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?

**2. A Solar System Census**

Asteroids and more.

**3. The Galactic Plane and Beyond: Transients, Variables and Static Stars in Crowded Regions**

[Variable stars will be of interest throughout the Local Group and beyond, and require cadence consideration.  Should those be their own Section?]  

Confirmed leads for variable stars: Lucianne Walkowitz, Michael Lund
Confirmed leads for extragalactic transients: Ashish Mahabal

Includes: Where does crowding begin to impact photometry, science cases for the plane (e.g. RRL to trace Galactic structures), variable stars with periods that drift during the survey, time sensitivity of color information to classify stellar transients and variables.

Confirmed leads for gaalctic plane science: Will Clarkson, Kathy Vivas

**4. Mapping Our Galaxy: Positions, Proper Motions and Parallax**

Includes: Time baseline and parallax factor distribution needed, distribution of and filter choice for superior seeing conditions for star galaxy separation, survey uniformity issues (see also Section 4).
