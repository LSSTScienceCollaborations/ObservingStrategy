# The LSST Observing Strategy

A community whitepaper outlining various science cases and the impacts that observing strategy will have on them, quantified using the Metric Analysis Framework. The paper will describe various cadence strategies, tradeoffs, current baseline, future directions, etc, and should be good enough to present on arXiv. The timescale for producing this white paper, started before and finished after the workshop is many months, hopefully before the next workshop. 

The main points to convey in this white paper are that:

* We have a pretty good idea of how we would deploy LSST: there is a baseline cadence, with which it can be demonstrated that the data required for the promised science can be delivered.
* The baseline cadence can and will be optimized - even small improvements can be significant. Most importantly, the cadence is not set in stone and it will evolve.
* The cadence optimization process will be as open and inclusive as technically possible. All stake holders will participate in this process.

A few possible paper titles:

* *“Current Baseline Design for LSST Deployment and Further Optimization”*
* *“Optimization Strategies for LSST Deployment”*
* *“Towards Optimal LSST Deployment”*
* *“Science Driven Optimization of LSST Deployment”*

**1. Introduction**
  * Synoptic Surveying with LSST - the basic observing strategy determined by the LSST's design.
  * Optimizing the Observing Strategy - what perturbations can we introduce, to maximize the system's science capabilities?

**2. A Solar System Census**

Asteroids and more.

**3. The Galactic Plane: Transients, Variables and Other Stars**

**4. Mapping Our Galaxy: Positions, Proper Motions and Parallax**

Mainly long timescale measurements?

**5. Rolling Cadence: Extragalactic Time Domain Astronomy and Its Impacts**

Includes: SNe, quasar variability, microlensing and reverberation mapping, but also stellar variability and fast transients...

**6. Keeping It Even: Accurate Cosmological Measurements on the Largest Scales**

Survey uniformity, dithering patterns, and related effects.

**7. Drilling Deep: Options for a Small Number of Enhanced Observation Fields**

**8. Special Surveys**

Includes LMC/SMC?

**8. Tensions and Trade-offs**

Discussion and conclusions chapter, at the end, highlighting the issues that we will need to figure out.
