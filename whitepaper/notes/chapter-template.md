The first part of each science chapter needs to outline, very briefly, the key science cases: what is to be measured and why this is of interest. Then, suppose we were to design an LSST survey to enable these measurements: qualitatively, what might it look like, in terms of the choices we are able to make? This discussion will conclude in a set of metrics that need to be computed for any given observing strategy, to quantify its impact on the above science cases. The second part of each chapter can then contain a MAF analysis of at least one OpSim run, concluding with a discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how these could be mitigated.
