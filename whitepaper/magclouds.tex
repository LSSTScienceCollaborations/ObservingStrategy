The Magellanic Clouds have always had outsized importance for
astrophysics.  They are critical steps in the cosmological distance
ladder, they are a binary galaxy system with a unique interaction
history, and they are laboratories for studying all manner of
astrophysical phenomena.  They are often used as jumping-off points
for investigations of much larger scope and scale; examples are the
searches for extragalactic supernova prompted by the explosion of
SN1987A and the dark matter searches through the technique of
gravitational microlensing.  More than 17,000 papers in the NASA ADS
include the words ``Magellanic Clouds'' in their abstracts or as part
of their keywords, highlighting their importance for a wide variety of
astronomical studies.

An LSST survey that did not include coverage of the Magellanic Clouds
and their periphery would be tragically incomplete.  LSST has a unique
role to play in surveys of the Clouds.  First, its large $A\Omega$
will allow us to probe the thousands of square degrees that comprise
the extended periphery of the Magellanic Clouds with unprecedented
completeness and depth, allowing us to detect and map their extended
disks, stellar halos, and debris from interactions that we already
have strong evidence must exist (REFS).  Second, the ability of LSST
to map the entire main bodies in only a few pointings will allow us to
identify and classify their extensive variable source populations with
unprecedented time and areal coverage, discovering, for example,
extragalactic planets, rare variables and transients, and light echoes
from explosive events that occurred thousands of years ago (REFS).
Finally, the large number of observing opportunities that the LSST
10-year survey will provide will enable us to produce a static imaging
mosaic of the main bodies of the Clouds with extraordinary image
quality, an invaluable legacy product of LSST.

We have several important scientific questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item What are the stellar and dark matter mass profiles of the
Magellanic Clouds?  Map extended disk, halo, debris, and streams.  Use
streams as probes of total mass profile.  RR Lyrae give potential for
three-dimensional stellar profile.

\item What is the satellite population of the Magellanic Clouds?
Discovery of dwarfs by DES and other surveys illuminating for
understanding distribution of dark matter subhalos and how galaxies
form in them (REFS)

\item What are the internal dynamics of the Magellanic Clouds?  Proper
motions from HST and from the ground (REFS) have measured the bulk
motions of the Clouds and have, in combination with spectroscopy,
begun to unravel the three dimensional internal dynamics of the
Clouds.

\item How do exoplanet statistics in the Magellanic Clouds compare to
those in the Milky Way?  Lund calculation shows can measure transits
of Jupiter-like planets, Clouds are lower metallicity environment

\item Identify and characterize the variable star and transient
population of the Clouds.  Population studies, linking to star
formation and chemical enrichment histories, etc, from Szkody et al.
DD white paper.

\item Light echoes from supernovae and explosive events.  Echoes can
give view of such events unavailable by any other means, ref. papers
by Rest et al.
\end{enumerate}


These questions can be grouped into main overarching science themes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Galaxy formation evolution}: The study of the formation and
evolution of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC,
respectively), especially their interaction with each other and the
Milky Way. The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are a unique local laboratory
for studying the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies in
exquisite detail.  LSST's large FOV will be able to map out the
three-dimensional structure, metallicity and kinematics in great
detail.
\item {\bf Stellar astrophysics \& Exoplanets}:  The MCs have been
used for decades to study stellar astrophysics, microlensing and other
processes.  The fact that the objects are effectively all at a single
known distance makes it much easier to study them than in, for
example, the Milky Way.  LSST will extend these studies to fainter
magnitudes, higher cadence, and larger area.
\end{enumerate}

Many different types of objects and measurements with their own
cadence ``requirements'' will fall into these two broad categories
(with some overlap).  These will be outlined in the next section.

A very important aspect of the ``galaxy evolution'' science theme is
not just the cadence but also the sky coverage of the Magellanic
Clouds ``mini-survey''.  A common misunderstanding is that the MCs
only cover a few degrees on the sky.  That is, however, just the
central regions of the MCs akin to the thinking of the Milky Way as
the just the bulge.  The full galaxies are actually much larger with
LMC stars detected at $\sim$21$^{\circ}$ ($\sim$18 kpc) and SMC stars
at $\sim$10$^{\circ}$ ($\sim$11 kpc) from their respective centers.
The extended stellar debris from their interaction likely extends to
even larger distances.  Therefore, to get a complete picture of the
complex structure of the MCs will require a mini-survey that covers
$\sim$2000 deg$^2$.  At this point, it not entirely clear how to
include this into the metrics.  Note, that for the second science case
this is not as much of an issue since the large majority of the
relevant objects will be located in the high-density, central regions
of the MCs.


% static science vs. variables
% cadence vs. areal coverage
%  -want to cover whole SCP area to some necessary depth
%  -cadence for time-variable objects in full area or portion
%    what's the minimal # of visits (with decent phase coverage) to do this?  ask Kathy
%    Paula Szkody white paper on doing the full MCs for variables, linked to old MC cadence page
%   maybe a separate metric for spatial structure
%   -variabes:  ability to recover period, classify,


% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\new{Below is a generic list of things we want to measure in the
Magellanic Clouds.}
% These will need to be divided among a small set of
% science sections, each describing a focused science project that has a
% figure of merit, that is a function of various diagnostic metrics. The
% final version of the chapter tex file probably will not contain this
% list.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Deep Color Magnitude Diagrams
%  -Deep CMDs, just a matter of number of visits
%  -do the full SMASH (and relevant DES area) with full spatial coverage, at least to SMASH depths, smaller
%  number of epochs, ~5 sigma at gri~25
% Knut thoughts: I think we want to make sure that we get 1 mag below old turnoff out to 100 kpc in ugriz with 10sigma precision, i.e. ugriz~25


\item Proper Motions
%-Proper Motions, cadence not as much of an issue, just more epochs
%  bulk proper motion
%  LMC spiral motion, streaming motions
%  internal velocity dispersion


%\item Parallaxes
%-Parallaxes, also mostly a function of nubmer of epochs
%  bulk distances
%  internal distance spread
%  -probably not get parallaxes at MC distances, but could do foreground rejection

\item Variable stars

%-Variables, RR Lyrae, Cepheids might be too bright, dwarf cepheids/scuti good, many more of them.
%   especially good for getting the 3D structure (out to large distances) of the MCs
%   -eclipsing binaries (get very accurate distances, see OGLE paper), pulsating WDs, CVs, T Tauri stars
% novae, supernovae  in Paula's white paper

% use MCs are a way to get templates for variable sources that LSST will detect all over the sky
% look at variable group metrics


\item Transients
%-Transients, dwarf novae
% Mike Lund will work on some text for this.  Also did work on cadence considerations
% for detecting periodic objects in general (periodogram purity function).

\item Transiting Exoplanets
% -Transiting planets, Mike Lund
% -need deep drilling to have any hope of finding them
% -best between ~0.8-1.6 Msun to detect exoplanets, not too faint
% -can't get ingress/egress but can detect the dip and periodicity
%   that's enough to characterize
% -challenging to do follow-up because they are quite faint and too many (?)
% -cadence?  cover all timescales properly
% -what's the expected period distribution

% See Lund et al.\ (2015) and the exoplanet discussion in previous part
% of this paper.

% PASP

%\item Astrometric binaries
%-Astrometric binaries

\item Light-echoes
% it's a surface-brightness issue, can see fainter things with LSST than MOSAIC/DECAM
% could trace out lightcurve if more epochs

\item Gyrochronology
%-Gychronology, need to get periods of the dwarfs, gives age information
%  -gyro periods are ~10 days at 1 Gyr and ~30 days at 10 Gyr

\item Interstellar scintillation
% run in movie mode for 1-2 nights to find missing molecular gas (H2)
% https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/68

% Legacy survey
% use the best seeing to get great data on the MC main bodies

%\item Astroseismology
%-Astroseismology, dwarfs/giants, giants vary by a couple percent and on "longer" timescales, but
%    probably too bright for LSST, OGLE probably has best data for those. however LSST might be able to do
%    asteroseismology of giants to larger distances, measure masses/ages of halo giants!
%    dwarfs are harder because they vary less and need more higher frequency observations
