\noindent The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is designed to
carry out a large synoptic survey: it has a baseline observing strategy, simulations of which demonstrate that the data required for
the promised science can be delivered.
However, this baseline strategy may well not be the {\it
best} way to schedule the telescope. Smaller, specialized surveys are
likely to provide high scientific value, as is optimizing the pattern of
repeated sky coverage.  Moreover, the baseline strategy is not set in
stone, and can and will be optimized. Even small changes could result in
significant improvements to the overall science yield. How can we design
an observing strategy that maximizes the scientific output of the LSST
system?

\noindent The LSST Observing Strategy community formed in July 2015 to
tackle this problem. Composed primarily (but not exclusively) of  LSST
Science Collaboration and LSST Project members, we are working together
to use the Metric Analysis Framework (\MAF) provided by the LSST Project
to evaluate simulations of the LSST survey (also provided by the
Project) specifically for the science that we each care most about. In
this way, we aim give sustainable quantitative feedback about how any
proposed observing strategy would impact the performance of our science
cases, and so enable good decisions to be made when the telescope
schedule is eventually set up.

\noindent This white paper is a compendium of ideas and results
generated by the community, assembled so that everyone can follow along
with the analysis. It is a living document, whose purpose is to bind
together the group of people who are thinking about the LSST observing
strategy problem, and facilitate their collective discussion and
understanding of that problem (a process we might think of as  ``cadence
diplomacy''). Its audience is the LSST science community, Science
Advisory Committee and Project Science Team: this white paper is   {\it
the} vehicle for the community to communicate to the LSST Project while
the baseline observing strategy continues to be improved.

\noindent The white paper's modular design allows pieces of it to be
split off and published in a series of snapshot journal papers, as the
various metric analyses reach maturity. The white paper itself will be
continuously published on
\href{https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy}{\GitHub}
and advertized periodically on \href{http://arxiv.org}{astro-ph}. This
white paper is large, but we hope that its hyperlinked structure helps
you quickly find the science cases that you are most interested in,
starting from the \hyperref[toc]{table of contents}.

\noindent The LSST observing strategy evaluation and optimization
process will be as open and inclusive as possible. New community members
are welcome at any time; we explain how to get involved in \autoref{sec:intro}.  We invite all stakeholders to participate.
