\noindent This is a community white paper outlining various science
cases and the impacts that observing strategy will have on them,
quantified using the Metric Analysis Framework. We will describe
various strategies and tradeoffs that impact the observing cadence
(visit sequence), the current cadence baseline, and future directions
for the optimization of the survey strategy. We aim to publish this
white paper on arXiv, and invite community feedback.

The timescale for producing this white paper, started before and
finished after the Observing Strategy workshop at the  August 2015
LSST Project and Community workshop, is many months.

The main points we will aim to convey in this white paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item We have a pretty good idea of how we would deploy LSST:
    there is a baseline strategy and example cadences, with which it
    can be demonstrated that the data required for the promised
    science can be delivered.

    \item The baseline strategy can and will be optimized -- even small
    improvements can be significant. Most importantly, the strategy is
    not set in stone and it will evolve.

    \item The cadence optimization process will be as open and
    inclusive as technically possible. All stakeholders will
    participate in this process.

\end{itemize}

Since this is a community white paper, contributions are welcome from
everyone. Read on for how to make a contribution, and how you should
structure that contribution.\footnote{These notes on the white paper

\subsection{How to get involved}

The first thing you should do is read and absorb the current version
of the white paper, which you should be able to
\href{http://ls.st/iw2}{view on \GitHub}. (You can also download the
``raw'' PDF, which is hyper-linked for easier navigation.) You will
then be able to provide good feedback, which you should do via the
\href{https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues}{\GitHub
issues}. Browse the existing issues first: there might be a
conversation you can  join. New issues are most welcome: we'd like to
make this white paper as comprehensive as possible.

To edit the white paper, you'll need to
\href{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/}{``fork'' its
repository}. You will then  be able to edit the paper in your own
fork, and when you are ready,  submit a
\href{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/}{``pull
request''} explaining what you are doing and the new version that  you
would like to be accepted. It's a good idea to submit this pull
request sooner rather than later, because associated with it will be a
discussion thread that the writing community can use to discuss your
ideas with you. For help getting started with \git and \GitHub, please

\subsection{Chapter and section design}

The first section of each science chapter needs to be an {\it introduction}
that outlines, very briefly, the commonality of the key science cases
contained in it:  what is to be measured, in broad-brush terms, and
why this is of interest. Then, suppose we were to design an LSST
survey to enable these measurements: qualitatively, what might it look
like, in terms of the choices we are able to make? This chapter
introduction can eventually (when the results are in!) summarize,
again, in very broad brush terms, the results of a number of
investigative sections, one on each science case.

The individual sections following this introduction will need to
describe the particular discoveries and measurements that are being
targeted in each {\it science case}. It will be helpful to think of a
``science case" as a ``science project" that the section leads {\it
actually plan to do}. Thinking this way means that the sections can
follow the tried and tested format of an observing proposal: a brief
description of the investigation, with references, followed by a
technical feasibility piece.  This latter part will need to be
quantified using the MAF framework, via a set of metrics that need to
be computed for any given observing strategy to quantify its impact on
the described science case. Ideally, these metrics would be combined
in a well-motivated figure of merit. The section can conclude with a
discussion of any risks that have been identified, and how these could
be mitigated.

The following two sections are an example chapter introduction and
science case section for you to work from. The latter is checked into
the repository as \texttt{section-template.tex}.
