\section{Introduction}

The observation of variable targets investigates the time domain, and thus realizes the essence of a synoptic survey.  Variable and transient studies are all about sampling, and different types and time scales of phenomena benefit from different sampling strategies - sometimes significantly different.  Competing objectives described in this chapter are at the heart of LSST observing strategy and cadence design.

Target types are here grouped in subsections by variability characteristics, but as will be seen, this does not mean that all targets in a group require a common cadence, since the times scales may vary dramatically.  Acquiring suitable data for a wide range of time scales presents a fundamental problem for LSST, since the available $~$800 visits to a field over the survey cannot be deployed so as to usefully sample all time scales at all times.  This fact leads to the concept of a non-uniform survey, in which parts of the sky are visited more frequently part of the time.  The merits of such options must be traded against the benefits of a more uniform survey strategy.
