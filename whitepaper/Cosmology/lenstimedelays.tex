\section{ Strong Gravitational Lens Time Delays }

The multiple images of strongly lensed quasars and supernovae have
delayed arrival times: variability in the first image will be observed
in the second image some time later, as the photons take different
paths around the deflector galaxy, and through different depths of
gravitational potential. If the lens mass distribution can be modeled
independently, using a combination of high resolution imaging of the
distorted quasar/SN host galaxy and stellar dynamics in the lens
galaxy, the measured time delays can be used to infer the ``time delay
distance'' in the system. This distance enables a direct measurement
of the Hubble constant, independent of the distance ladder.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}

For this cosmological probe to be competitive with LSST's others, the
time delays of several hundred systems (which will be distributed
uniformly over the extragalactic sky) will need to be measured with
bias below the sub-percent level, while the precision required is a
few percent per lens.  In galaxy-scale lenses, the kind that are most
accurately modeled, these time delays are typically between several
days and several weeks long, and so are measurable in monitoring
campaigns having night-to-night cadence of between one and a few days,
and seasons lasting several months or more.

To obtain accurate as well as precise lensed quasar time delays, several
monitoring seasons are required. Lensed supernova time delays have not
yet been measured, but their transient nature means that their time
delay measurements may be more sensitive to cadence than season or
campaign length.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

Anticipating that the time delay accuracy would depend on night-to-night
cadence, season length, and campaign length, we carried out a large
scale simulation and measurement program that coarsely sampled these
schedule properties. In \citet{LiaoEtal2015}, we simulated 5 different
light curve datasets, each containing 1000 lenses, and presented them to
the strong lensing community in a ``Time Delay Challenge.'' These 5
challenge ``rungs'' differed by their schedule properties, in the ways
shown in \autoref{tab:tdcrungs}. Focusing on the best challenge
submissions made by the community, we derived a simple power law model
for the variation of each of the time delay accuracy, time delay
precision, and useable sample fraction, with the schedule properties
cadence, season length and campaign length. These models are shown in
\autoref{fig:tdcresults}, reproduced from \citet{LiaoEtal2015}, and are
given by the following equations:
\begin{align}
|A|_{\rm model} &\approx 0.06\% \left(\frac{\rm cad} {\rm 3 days}  \right)^{0.0}
                          \left(\frac{\rm sea}  {\rm 4 months}\right)^{-1.0}
                          \left(\frac{\rm camp}{\rm 5 years} \right)^{-1.1} \notag \\
  P_{\rm model} &\approx 4.0\% \left(\frac{\rm cad} {\rm 3 days}  \right)^{ 0.7}
                         \left(\frac{\rm sea}  {\rm 4 months}\right)^{-0.3}
                         \left(\frac{\rm camp}{\rm 5 years} \right)^{-0.6} \notag \\
  f_{\rm model} &\approx 30\% \left(\frac{\rm cad} {\rm 3 days}  \right)^{-0.4}
                        \left(\frac{\rm sea}  {\rm 4 months}\right)^{ 0.8}
                        \left(\frac{\rm camp}{\rm 5 years} \right)^{-0.2} \notag
\end{align}

All three of these metrics would, in an ideal world, be optimized:
this could be achieved by decreasing the night-to-night cadence (to
better sample the light curves), extending the observing season length
(to maximize the chances of capturing a strong variation and its
echo), and extending the campaign length (to increase the number of
effective time delay measurements). A combined figure of merit should
therefore be readily available.

The quantity of greatest scientific interest is the {\it accuracy in
cosmological parameters}: this coudl be computed as follows. Setting a
required accuracy threshold  defines the available number of lenses,
which in turns gives us the mean precision per lens there. Combining the
whole sample, we would get the error on the weighted mean time delay,
and can equate that to the statistical uncertainty on the Hubble
constant. The Figure of merit would be the final precision on $H_0$, as
a way to sum up the sample size and time delay measurability (at fixed
accuracy requirement).

\subsection{\OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

% \OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
% the time of writing for this science project?

In this section we present the results of our ongoing \OpSim / MAF
analysis, as we try to
answer the question ``how good would the proposed observing
strategies be, for time delay lens cosmography?''

We used the
\simsMAFcontrib{SeasonStacker}{mafContrib/seasonStacker.py} to work
with seasons, rather than calendar years.
We used \texttt{ops2\_1075} \OpSim run for most of our tests, but plan
to re-run on \opsimdbref{db:baseCadence} and
\opsimdbref{db:NoVisitPairs}, in order to assess the new baseline
cadence and compare it against a simulated observing strategy where
the visit pair requirement is relaxed.

% \todo{PJM}{Correct the above paragraphs and add more links to MAF code.}

\autoref{fig:lenstimedelays:results} shows the results of our MAF
analysis of one \OpSim database, \texttt{ops2\_1075}, where we have
assumed that all filters were able to be used in the light curve
analysis (as was implicitly assumed when applying the results of
\citeauthor{LiaoEtal2015}). These sky maps show that, over the main
(WDF) survey area, the time delay accuracy, time delay precision and
time delay lens success fraction are consistently maintained,
indicating that the global average values of these metrics could
conceivably used as higher level metrics or even figure of merit.

% \autoref{tab:lenstimedelays:results} shows the global (i.e. all-sky)
% average values of our metrics, for two different \OpSim
% databases and two different filter set assumptions.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

% \todo{PJM}{Write lens time delays discussion section.}

The main risk involved with this science case
is that the multi-filter light curve analysis will not be well approximated by
the real-life combination of all 6 filters together.
The second time delay challenge (TDC2) will help answer this
question.  For now, just using 2 filters gives a lower limit on the
overall precision we should expect.

We would expect the relaxation of the visit pairs requirement to
increase the  night to night cadence by a factor of two, if the visits
are redistributed randomly in time. If \OpSim is not being as liberal as
this, we may not see much improvement over the baseline cadence:
efficiency maximization could be preventing visits being fully split. We
are interested in any changes to the WFD survey time sampling that
reduce the inter-night gaps: these  would include rolling cadence
schemes.

% Also need to assess 1 vs 3 vs 10 year light curves. How do metrics
% improve? What will be possible in the early part of the survey?

%
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[Q1:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the

% the sky coverage be maximized (to $\sim$30,000 deg$^2$, as e.g., in
% Pan-STARRS) or the number of detected galaxies (the current baseline but
% with 18,000 deg$^2$)?}
%
% \item[A1:] ...
%
% \item[Q2:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between uniformity of sampling and frequency of  sampling? For
% example, a rolling cadence can provide enhanced sample rates over a part
% of the survey or the entire survey for a designated time at the cost of
% reduced sample rate the rest of the time (while maintaining the nominal
% total visit counts).}
%
% \item[A2:] ...
%
% \item[Q3:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% tradeoff between the single-visit depth and the number of visits
% (especially in the $u$-band where longer exposures would minimize the
% impact of the readout noise)?}
%
% \item[A3:] ...
%
% \item[Q4:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
% Galactic plane coverage (spatial coverage, temporal sampling, visits per

%
% \item[A4:] ...
%
% \item[Q5:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the

% benefit if they are obtained in the same band or not?}
%
% \item[A7:] ...
%
% \item[Q8:] {\it Will the case science benefit from a special cadence
% prescription during commissioning or early in the survey, such as:

%
% \item[A8:] ...
