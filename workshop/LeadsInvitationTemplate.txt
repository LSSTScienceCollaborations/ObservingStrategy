Dear XXX,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Science Organizing Committee for the LSST 2015 Cadence Workshop (Bremerton, WA, Aug 20-22, 2015). One of the main goals of this workshop is to revisit science drivers for various LSST programs with an eye towards optimizing the baseline observing strategy (for more details please see the attached First Announcement).  We've designed this workshop to take a highly interactive and flexible approach to cadence planning, while coupling it with a specific deliverable: a white paper written after the workshop, which will describe cadence strategies, tradeoffs, current baseline, open questions and future directions. 

Given your leadership role in the field of XXX and your interest in LSST, the SOC identified you as a key person with the vision and skills needed to lead a section of this white paper, and to do this in coordination with many experts interested in LSST.  I'm therefore writing to ask whether you would be willing to lead the XXXX section. We recognize that this will require a fair amount of effort (see below for details), and hope that you're as excited as we are for this opportunity to have a guiding hand in the strategic planning of LSST's operations. 

Observing Strategies White Paper schedule
1. Now: White paper section leads begin to organize expert co-authors relevant to their white paper section. More contributors will be accreted at the workshop and beyond and the SOC is happy to suggest names;
2. June-July: To maximize the efficiency of cadence work during the August workshop in Bremerton, each white paper section should be started prior to the workshop (by leads plus co-authors of your choosing) with a summary the current understanding of various observing strategy issues.  The pre-workshop goal is to identify and prioritize open issues.
3. August: At the workshop, white paper section leads will have a guiding hand in the related discussions;
4. Sept-Dec: After the workshop, white paper section leads will engage in further work to deliver an arXiv publishable product by the end of 2015.

At this time we can't make a hard promise, but there might be an opportunity to have LSST Corporation sponsor a working meeting, e.g. in Tucson, around Oct-Nov timeframe, for us to work together on the white paper. 

We hope that you will join us in this endeavor!  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely, XXX 

PS. I am attaching the first announcement where you can find more details about the workshop, such as schedule and the SOC membership.
