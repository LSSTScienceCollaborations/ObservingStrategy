# MAF Workshop Design

The two main goals for the workshop are:

1) To involve more people in defining more MAF metrics, and
2) To revisit several science cases which need to deliver more quantitative details for designing simulated surveys (such as Galactic plane coverage, LMC/SMC coverage, rolling cadence tradeoffs, North ecliptic spur coverage, deep drilling, dithering patterns).

The ultimate deliverable is a white paper (on some reasonable timescale after the
workshop; definitely many months, hopefully before the next workshop) describing
cadence strategies, tradeoffs, current baseline, future directions, etc. It should be
good enough to go to arXiv.

### Before the Workshop

* Tutorial plan
* Homework

### The Meeting Itself

* Attendance
* Schedule - talks, hack sessions.

### After the Workshop

* Activities
* Timeline

### Community building

* Workshop email list? Or wider? Using github issues, etc.
* Advertising: meeting website, email timeline etc.


### Notes

At the first cadence workshop, it was very helpful to have MAF tutorials prior to the workshop. A lot of work will need to be done *prior* to the workshop. We cannot effectively support a large number of people, but this may not matter: only a fairly small number of people have developed new MAF metrics, and to get the best out of the workshop time, most attendees will need to have technical background. The workshop emphasis will be on coding within MAF; this needs to be made clear during the application process.
