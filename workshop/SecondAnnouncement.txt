“An LSST Community Workshop: Science Driven Optimization of LSST's
Observing Strategy” August 20-22, 2015; Kitsap Conference Center,
Bremerton, WA

The 2nd announcement (June 12, 2015)

Meeting Rationale:

Are you interested in contributing to planning LSST's Observing Strategy?  Then
this workshop is for you.  It will be the second in a series of LSST
workshops aimed at engaging the community interested in LSST to help
optimize its observing strategy.

This past year, the LSST Project generated a large number of simulated
Observing Strategies. These simulations can be used to quantitatively
assess the scientific capabilities of any given implementation of
LSST's core survey operations
(https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/OpSim+Datasets+for+Cadence+Workshop+LSST2015).

The main goal of the 2015 workshop is to identify quantitative metrics
with which simulated LSST survey realizations can be tested for
scientific efficacy.  FOR EXAMPLE, ...

This workshop will also: 

1) Engage a broad community in defining more robust and quantitative
   science drivers for regions beyond LSST's core survey area (the
   coverage of the Galactic Plane, LMC/SMC, south Galactic Pole area,
   and the Ecliptic plane),

2) Begin the definition and editing of a community white paper about
   LSST observing strategy and its science-driven optimization,

3) Present a status update on LSST's Observing Strategy optimization,
   and report on the analysis of the new set of simulated surveys, and

4) Describe tools developed by the LSST Project for assessing the
   scientific potential of simulated cadences (Metrics Analysis
   Framework), and provide expert training for those who are willing
   to adopt the MAF in their research and LSST-related work. There
   will be pre-workshop activities describing and introducing MAF,
   details will be provided in the Second Announcement. Participation
   in these activities, or familiarity with MAF, is not required to
   attend the workshop.
