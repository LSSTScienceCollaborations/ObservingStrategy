# Suggestions for New OpSim Runs

While we write down our science cases and code up their metrics and
Figures of Merit, we can also think about which `OpSim` experiments
we want to carry out, to explore the possibilities the LSST offers.

## Guidelines

The [LSST Observing Strategy White Paper](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/raw/master/whitepaper/LSST_Observing_Strategy_White_Paper.pdf) contains a chapter (2) listing the 2015 `OpSim` runs. The output databases from these
experiments are available for us to run our MAF metrics on. This chapter gives some initial feel for what is possible, and what has already been done. Our first task: read that chapter.

To suggest a new `OpSim` run, you will (of course) need to write a very short *proposal*. You can do this in a markdown file following [this template]() and check it into the `opsim` folder of this repository. Then, add it to the Table below, so everyone can see what you are suggesting and follow the link to your proposal.
