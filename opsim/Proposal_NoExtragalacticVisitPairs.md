# Proposed `OpSim` Experiment: "No Extragalactic Visit Pairs"

*Proposer(s): Phil Marshall*


## Proposed Changes to the Observing Strategy

In a specified sky area, prevent `OpSim` from returning to any given
field on the same night, in order to increase the night-to-night
frequency of observations. The sky area in question is the
extragalactic sky, away from both the ecliptic plane and the galactic
plane.

## Science Motivation

Slow extragalactic transients (like supernovae), and extragalactic
variables with characteristic timescales of weeks-months (like AGN),
should become measurable with significantly higher precision.
Photometric supernova cosmology with hundreds of thousands of SNe
might become possible.
