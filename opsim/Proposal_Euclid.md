"Coordination Strategy with EUCLID"

A Proposed OpSim Experiment.

*Proposer(s): Andrew Connolly, Tony Tyson

*Issue Thread: [#01](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/ObservingStrategy/issues/01)*


## Proposed Changes to the Observing Strategy

We propose a special survey that would extend the LSST footprint into
the north to a dec limit of +30 degrees with bounds in Galactic
latitude (|b| > 20) and Ecliptic Latitude (|b| > 15). 1% of the time
would be assigned to this survey with a goal of 10 visits in
ugrizy. There would be no requirement on pairs of visits and the
objective would be to schedule this time early in the LSST survey (within the first 2 years). 


## Science Motivation

EUCLID will undertake a medium-deep survey covering 15,000 sq degrees
of the sky to approximately AB=24.7 in the near-infrared bands. A
comparable depth in the optical can be achieved with a small number of
LSST pointings which would enable photometric redshifts to be
generated. Given that Euclid is expected to launch in 2020 early LSST
observations will maximize the early science from Euclid
