## Proposed Changes to the Observing Strategy

We propose improved coverage of the WFIRST microlensing field located 
approximately at the Galactic coordinates l = 1 deg, b = -1 deg.
First, we propose observations with 15 minute cadence simultaneously with 
the WFIRST observations, i.e., during each of six 72-day WFIRST exoplanet 
campaigns. The campaigns are in spring and fall (3 starting in fall 2026 and 
3 starting in 2029) when the field is visible for a short time each night.
Second, we propose additional single visit each night outside 
the WFIRST campaigns. These observations should start a year before and end 
a year after the WFIRST microlensing survey.

The WFIRST microlensing field is approximately defined by a polygon in (l,b) 
coordinates:
(-0.5, -2.04), (-0.5, -1.24), (0.73, -1.24), (0.73, -0.46), (1.62, -0.46), (1.62, -2.04).
The field can be fully covered by a single LSST pointing. We request 
observations in *z* or *i* bands because of high extinction.

## Science Motivation

The simultaneous observations of a planetary microlensing event from
the ground and a satellite allow direct measurement of the planet mass
and distance thanks to the microlensing parallax effect.
The combination of the WFIRST and the LSST observations is a unique
opportunity to measure the masses of the free-floating planets.
We request observations with cadence matched to WFIRST and to be taken in
the red filters to reduce the impact of interstellar extinction.

The second part of the proposed observations will allow better
characterization of some of the WFIRST events, most importantly the ones
that show planetary signals during the WFIRST campaigns,
but planet host peak is not covered by the WFIRST. In the extreme cases,
the LSST observations will allow detection of host stars for planets
that seem free-floating based on the WFIRST data alone. The LSST observations
will also prompt higher-cadence observations on smaller telescopes
for events showing particularly interesting features.

WFIRST will image the microlensing field around 15,000 times with
HST-like quality. This wealth of data will allow multiple additional
investigations for which LSST coverage may be useful:
accurate measurements of parallaxes and proper motions,
studies of variable stars, and investigation of Solar System bodies.
